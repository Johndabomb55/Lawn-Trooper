ROLE:
You are a senior product engineer + conversion copy editor improving lawn-trooper.com.
RETROFIT ONLY. Do NOT redesign the site. Keep layout and styling. Update copy + bonus naming + placement to implement the “25-Year Birthday Bonus” in a premium, clear way with correct math.

PRIMARY GOAL:
Implement a new bonus name and phased enrollment schedule:
- Marketing name: “25-Year Birthday Bonus”
- Formal label (optional): “25th Anniversary Enrollment Bonus”
The bonus must be applied as SKIPPED BILLING MONTHS at the end of the term (it does NOT extend the contract).

========================================
A) DEFINITIONS (COPY MUST MATCH)
========================================

1) Everywhere “free months / bonus months” are described, ensure this is clear:
- “Complimentary months are skipped billing months applied at the end of your term.”
- “Your agreement still ends on your 12-month or 24-month anniversary date.”
- “You pay for fewer months, but the term length remains the same.”

No copy should imply the customer receives extra months beyond the term end date.

========================================
B) COMMITMENT BONUS (ALWAYS ON)
========================================

2) Commitment Bonus is separate from the Birthday Bonus:
- 1-Year Subscription: +1 complimentary month
- 2-Year Subscription: +2 complimentary months
- Month-to-Month: 0 complimentary months (because we reward commitment)

3) Pay-in-Full doubles the COMMITMENT BONUS ONLY (not the Birthday Bonus):
- 1-Year PIF => 2 commitment months
- 2-Year PIF => 4 commitment months

========================================
C) 25-YEAR BIRTHDAY BONUS (PHASED)
========================================

4) Implement “25-Year Birthday Bonus” as the enrollment bonus.
This replaces/renames any prior “25th Anniversary Enrollment Bonus” wording on UI.
If you want to keep the formal name, show both:
“25th Anniversary Enrollment Bonus (25-Year Birthday Bonus)”
But default to “25-Year Birthday Bonus” as the visible user-facing name.

5) Phased bonus schedule:
- Enroll by Jan 25 => +2 bonus months
- Enroll by Feb 25 => +1 bonus month
- Enroll after Feb 25 => +0 (bonus concluded)

6) Display behavior:
- On homepage/hero: add a subtle mention without numbers:
  “Celebrating 25 years — long-term subscribers may qualify for our 25-Year Birthday Bonus.”
- In the builder (Step 5): show the actual phased bonus amounts with dates.
- On/after March: show “Bonus concluded” in muted text; do NOT remove it completely.

========================================
D) MATH (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
========================================

7) Use these variables:
termMonths = 12 or 24
commitmentFreeMonths = 1 or 2 (depending on 1-year vs 2-year)
payInFullMultiplier = 1 or 2 (applies to commitment months only)
birthdayBonusMonths = 0, 1, or 2 (based on date window)

8) Total free months:
totalFreeMonths =
  (commitmentFreeMonths * payInFullMultiplier) +
  birthdayBonusMonths

9) Billed months:
billedMonths = termMonths - totalFreeMonths

10) Effective monthly (display only):
effectiveMonthly = (monthlySubscription * billedMonths) / termMonths

Rules:
- effectiveMonthly must always be <= monthlySubscription
- no fractional months
- month-to-month has 0 totalFreeMonths

========================================
E) STEP 5 COPY & LAYOUT (CLARITY FIX)
========================================

11) Step 5 must clearly separate the two bonuses to avoid confusion:
- “Commitment Bonus” section
- “25-Year Birthday Bonus” section

Example layout:

Commitment Bonus:
• 1-Year: +1 month
• 2-Year: +2 months
• Pay in full doubles commitment months

25-Year Birthday Bonus (Enrollment Bonus):
• Enroll by Jan 25: +2 months
• Enroll by Feb 25: +1 month
• After Feb 25: Bonus concluded

Then show:
“Total complimentary billing months earned: X”
and the disclaimer:
“Applied as skipped billing months at the end of your term.”

12) Remove any UI labels that imply:
“1-Year automatically gets +2 or +3 months”
unless those months are explicitly listed in the breakdown.

========================================
F) QA / TESTING (REQUIRED)
========================================

13) Test scenarios:
- Month-to-Month: shows 0 complimentary months
- 1-Year (no PIF) in Jan window: 1 + 2 = 3 months
- 1-Year (PIF) in Jan window: 2 + 2 = 4 months
- 2-Year (no PIF) in Jan window: 2 + 2 = 4 months
- 2hin 2-Year (PIF) in Jan window: 4 + 2 = 6 months
- Same tests in Feb window produce +1 instead of +2
- After Feb 25 produces +0 birthday bonus

14) Confirm:
- All totals update live when toggles change
- Effective monthly never increases when free months increase
- Copy never implies the contract term is extended
- Bonus name is “25-Year Birthday Bonus” everywhere intended

DELIVERABLE:
Provide a short report listing files changed and confirming:
- correct bonus naming and placement
- correct math in every scenario above
- copy clarity (skipped billing months at end of term)
