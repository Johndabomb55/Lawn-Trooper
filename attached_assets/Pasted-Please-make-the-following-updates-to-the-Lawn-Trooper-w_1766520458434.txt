Please make the following updates to the Lawn Trooper website. Apply all changes in one pass and do not modify anything not explicitly listed.
Hero Image / Logo / Visuals
Make the top image/logo area larger so the image width visually matches the width of the “Lawn Trooper” text.
Keep the existing man and yard exactly the same.
Add two additional crew members working on the same property to create a total of three crew members.
The added crew members should be of different races to reflect diversity.
All crew members should wear professional, military-inspired landscaping uniforms (earth tones, tactical but clean, no weapons).
Add Meta-style smart glasses (Ray-Ban Meta look) to all three crew members to emphasize a tech-centered landscaping company.
Add a large commercial mower in the background. Do NOT reference or label any brand. The mower should be camo or earth-tone colored and look modern and professional.
Extend the background image instead of fading it out. Increase color consistency and richness so the image looks vibrant but still realistic and professional.
Pricing Structure Update
Change all acreage pricing increments from 1/4 acre to 1/3 acre.
Apply a 25% price increase for each additional 1/3 acre across all plans.
Ensure this rule is clearly stated and consistently applied everywhere pricing appears.
Service Plans
Update the plan descriptions to include the previously discussed additions (winter bi-weekly visits, yard pickup, storm stick pickup, optional special visits).
Keep the structure simple and easy to understand.
Make sure each plan clearly shows what is included versus what is optional.
Add-On Services
Add a detailed add-on list that clearly explains each service in plain language.
The add-on list should feel premium, flexible, and customizable.
Do not duplicate services already included in plans.
Keep formatting clean and readable.
General Rules
Do not remove any existing content unless required by the changes above.
Do not change the site layout beyond what is necessary to implement these updates.
Maintain the Lawn Trooper brand tone: professional, tech-forward, trustworthy, efficient.
After completing these changes, stop. Do not suggest additional edits or features.
