You are a senior full-stack engineer working on an EXISTING Lawn Trooper quote wizard.
This is a RETROFIT job. Do NOT rebuild or redesign the site. Make minimal, precise changes.
Preserve current layout, styling, and routing unless explicitly instructed.

PRIMARY GOAL:
Fix and finalize the add-ons system so it is:
- Fully source-of-truth driven
- Clear to customers
- Impossible to drift again
- Honest and “addictive” to configure
- Correctly handles Executive add-on math and swap behavior

====================================
GLOBAL NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
====================================
- Use only these canonical plan tier keys in code:
  basic / premium / executive
- UI labels may say:
  “Basic Patrol / Premium Patrol / Executive Command”
  but logic must use canonical keys.
- NEVER hide add-ons when included slots are used.
- Add-ons must always be visible; overages add price live.
- Anywhere add-ons are referenced, always say:
  “X Basic + Y Premium”
  Never say “X add-ons included” generically.
- Step 3 (plan cards) and Step 4 (add-ons) MUST read from the same config object.
- Remove all “View details” buttons/links in Step 3.

====================================
PHASE 1 — SOURCE OF TRUTH CLEANUP
====================================
1. Locate the REAL add-on data source.
   - Identify where add-ons are currently defined (stub arrays, partial lists, CMS, etc.).
   - Stop using any partial or duplicated add-on lists.

2. Create or confirm ONE canonical add-on catalog:
   - File example: src/config/addons.ts
   - Each add-on must include:
     id, name, tier (basic | premium | executive),
     category, price, description

3. Remove all duplicate/legacy add-on definitions from components.
   - All add-on UI and pricing logic must import from this catalog.

====================================
PHASE 2 — PLAN CONFIG (SOURCE OF TRUTH)
====================================
4. Create/confirm plan config file:
   - Example: src/config/plans.ts
   - Each plan must define:
     planId, planName,
     includedBasicAddOns,
     includedPremiumAddOns,
     allowsSwap (boolean),
     executiveExtras (optional array of strings)

FINAL INCLUDED COUNTS (LOCKED):
- Basic:
  includedBasicAddOns = 1
  includedPremiumAddOns = 0

- Premium:
  includedBasicAddOns = 2
  includedPremiumAddOns = 1
  allowsSwap = false

- Executive:
  includedBasicAddOns = 3
  includedPremiumAddOns = 2
  allowsSwap = true
  executiveExtras = [
    "Unlimited Mulch",
    "After-Storm Visits",
    "Bi-Weekly Winter Visits & Yard Checks"
  ]

====================================
PHASE 3 — STEP 3 (PLAN SELECTION UI)
====================================
5. Remove ALL “View details” links/buttons in Step 3.
   - Delete modals or accordions unless they contain critical info.
   - If critical info exists, migrate it into the plan card text.

6. On each plan card, add a visible add-on breakdown line
   directly under the feature bullets:

   - Basic:
     “Add-Ons Included: 1 Basic + 0 Premium”

   - Premium:
     “Add-Ons Included: 2 Basic + 1 Premium”

   - Executive:
     “Add-Ons Included: 3 Basic + 2 Premium”
     Optional second line:
     “Swap option: 1 Premium = 2 Basic”

7. These values MUST come from the same plan config used by Step 4.
   - No hardcoded numbers allowed.

====================================
PHASE 4 — STEP 4 (ADD-ONS STEP CORE LOGIC)
====================================
8. Filter visible add-ons by plan tier:
   - Basic plan → show Basic add-ons
   - Premium plan → show Basic + Premium
   - Executive plan → show Basic + Premium + Executive Exclusives

9. Organize the add-ons UI with clear headers:
   - Basic Add-Ons
   - Premium Add-Ons
   - Executive Exclusives
   - Cleaning & Wash
   - Trash Can Cleaning
   - Seasonal / Christmas Lights

   (Categories are for UI grouping only; pricing tier still drives logic.)

10. Remove scroll-trap behavior inside the add-ons container.
    - If internal scroll is unavoidable, make it obvious and smooth.

11. Add info tooltips for EVERY add-on.
    - Tooltip text comes from add-on description field.
    - Include scope/limits (caps, quantities, etc.).

====================================
PHASE 5 — EXECUTIVE SWAP MECHANIC (CRITICAL)
====================================
12. Replace any existing swap checkbox with a SWAP SELECTOR.
    - Visible ONLY when Executive plan is selected.
    - Label:
      “Swap Premium slots for additional Basic slots”
    - Options:
      0 / 1 / 2
    - Default = 0

13. Swap rules (LOCKED):
    - Executive base included = 3 Basic + 2 Premium
    - Each swap converts:
      1 Premium → +2 Basic

    Therefore:
    - Swap 0 → Included = 3B + 2P
    - Swap 1 → Included = 5B + 1P
    - Swap 2 → Included = 7B + 0P

14. Swap affects INCLUDED LIMITS ONLY.
    - It does NOT change per-item prices.

15. Swap selection must update included counters LIVE.

====================================
PHASE 6 — LIVE COUNTERS & PRICING
====================================
16. Display counters above add-on lists:

    - Selected:
      “Selected: X Basic, Y Premium”

    - Included (after swap):
      “Included: A Basic + B Premium”

17. When user exceeds included:
    - Show overage line:
      “Overage: +n Basic (+$20/mo each), +m Premium (+$40/mo each)”
    - Update total price immediately.

18. Overages pricing (LOCKED):
    - Basic overage = +$20/mo
    - Premium overage = +$40/mo

19. NEVER prevent selection.
    - Users may exceed included limits freely.
    - Pricing must reflect it live.

====================================
PHASE 7 — SUMMARY & CHECKOUT
====================================
20. Step 5 and Step 6 must reflect:
    - Swap-adjusted included counts
    - Selected Basic & Premium counts
    - Any overage charges

21. Fix “effective monthly” calculation if present.
    - Effective monthly after free months MUST NEVER be higher
      than actual monthly.
    - Free months = skipped billing months at end.

====================================
PHASE 8 — QA REQUIREMENTS
====================================
22. Test cases to confirm:

    A) Executive, Swap 0 (3B+2P):
       Select 4B + 2P →
       Shows +1 Basic overage = +$20/mo

    B) Executive, Swap 1 (5B+1P):
       Select 5B + 2P →
       Shows +1 Premium overage = +$40/mo

    C) Executive, Swap 2 (7B+0P):
       Select any Premium →
       Premium overage applies immediately

23. Confirm:
    - No “View details” links remain
    - Step 3 and Step 4 never drift
    - Add-ons never disappear
    - Pricing updates instantly

====================================
