You are updating the Lawn Trooper instant quote system and checkout experience.
This prompt replaces all previous pricing, add-on, and promo logic.
Follow this exactly.

================================================
A) CORE PRICING & PAYMENT STRUCTURE
================================================

1) BASE PRICING
- Define a base monthly price for each plan (Basic, Premium, Executive).
- The base monthly price assumes a 1-year agreement.

2) MONTH-TO-MONTH PREMIUM
- Month-to-month pricing carries a 15% premium over the 1-year rate.
- Formula:
  monthToMonthPrice = baseYearlyMonthly * 1.15
- Copy shown to users:
  “Month-to-month includes flexibility pricing.”

3) PAYMENT OPTIONS
Offer three payment methods:
- Monthly (default)
- Yearly (one payment per year)
- Pay in full (entire term upfront)

Payment method does NOT change service cadence.

================================================
B) AGREEMENT TERMS & FREE MONTH LOGIC
================================================

1) TERM OPTIONS
- Month-to-month
- 1-year
- 2-year

2) FREE MONTH RULES (STACKABLE)
- 1-year term → +1 free month
- 2-year term → +2 free months
- Pay in full → +1 free month
- Referral → +1 free month AFTER signup (displayed but NOT included in effective monthly)

3) FREE MONTH DISPLAY
- Show “You’ve unlocked X free months”
- Free months apply ONLY as service credits at the END of the agreement.
- Free months are never cash-equivalent.

================================================
C) EFFECTIVE MONTHLY vs ACTUAL MONTHLY
================================================

1) DISPLAY RULES
- During quote flow:
  SMALL / MUTED:
  “Effective monthly after free months: $X/mo”
- Tooltip text:
  “Effective monthly shows the average cost after your free months are applied at the end of your agreement.”

- Final checkout page:
  LARGE / PRIMARY:
  “Your monthly payment: $Y/mo”
  SMALL SUBTEXT:
  “Free months are applied as service credits at the end of your agreement.”

2) EFFECTIVE MONTHLY FORMULA
- baseMonthly = selected plan price (with 15% premium applied if month-to-month)
- termMonths = 12 or 24 (term plans)
- freeMonthsEarned = term bonus + pay-in-full bonus
- paidMonths = max(termMonths - freeMonthsEarned, 1)
- effectiveMonthly = (baseMonthly * termMonths) / paidMonths

IMPORTANT:
- If month-to-month is selected, effectiveMonthly = actualMonthly
- Do NOT include referral bonus in effectiveMonthly calculation

================================================
D) CANCELLATION RULES (DISPLAY CLEARLY)
================================================

1) MONTH-TO-MONTH
- Cancel anytime with 30 days notice
- No free months earned

2) TERM PLANS (1-YEAR / 2-YEAR)
- Cancel anytime
- Free months and unused credits are forfeited if canceled early

DISPLAY THIS COPY ON CHECKOUT:

Term plans may be canceled early at any time; free months and unused credits are forfeited if canceled before the term ends.”
