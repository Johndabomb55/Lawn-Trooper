You are an expert web designer and copywriter. 

Create a SINGLE, RESPONSIVE landing page for a company called **Lawn Trooper**.

Goal: Convert visitors from online ads into paying **yard subscription** customers as fast and simply as possible.

Tech requirements:
- Use plain HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of vanilla JavaScript if needed.
- No external frameworks.
- Clean, modern, fast-loading, mobile-first.
- Everything in one file (index.html style).

Brand & vibe:
- Residential lawn care with a **disciplined, military-inspired** theme.
- Colors: earth tones and patriotic accents: deep army green, dark forest green, tan, off-white, and small touches of gold or muted red.
- Mascot vibe: confident but friendly “Lawn Trooper” – think soldier with a weed eater like a rifle (no weapons imagery, just the playful metaphor).
- Tone: **reliable, professional, tech-savvy, subscription-based, no-stress yard care**.

Business concept:
Lawn Trooper is a **subscription lawn service** that keeps your yard looking perfect all season with predictable monthly pricing. We use a mix of **smart robotic mowers and pro technicians** in clean uniforms, driving modern, efficient vehicles. The customer never has to worry about calling, scheduling, or remembering yard care again.

Core promise:
> “Set it once. Your yard stays mission-ready all year.”

Key benefits (turn into icons or bullet features near the top):
- Weekly or regular mowing included
- Clear subscription plans (no surprise charges)
- Priority scheduling & reliable show-up
- Tech-driven efficiency = better value
- Friendly, background-checked lawn techs
- Easy communication by text/email

Subscription structure (IMPORTANT):
Price is based on **yard size by quarter acre**, not just the plan.
Show a **simple pricing table** with sample prices the customer can edit later.

Three plans:
1. **Basic Patrol**
   - For small to medium yards.
   - Includes regular mowing and edging.
   - Includes **2 free off-season add-ons** per year (examples: leaf pickup, light shrub trim, spring cleanup, etc.).
   - Billed monthly with a 1-year or 2-year agreement.

2. **Premium Command**
   - Everything in Basic.
   - Plus: routine weed control along edges, light bed cleanup, and a more polished “always-ready” look.
   - Includes **2 Basic add-ons + 3 Premium add-ons** per year (Premium examples: deeper seasonal cleanups, light mulching, minor hedging).
   - Better per-cut effective rate than Basic for the same yard size.
   - Billed monthly with 1-year or 2-year agreement.

3. **Executive Deployment**
   - For customers who want **“I never think about my yard again”**.
   - Includes everything in Premium plus priority service, more detailed bed care, and extra seasonal attention.
   - Includes **2 Basic add-ons + 6 Premium add-ons** per year.
   - **No install/setup fee** (waived) on 2-year agreements.
   - **Best value per visit**.
   - Designed to be irresistible for people who value time and curb appeal.

Contracts & promos (explain clearly and simply):
- **Month-to-month billing**, but with a commitment:
  - 1-year agreement: **1 free month** built in.
  - 2-year agreement: **3 free months total** built in.
- If they **pay in full up front**, they get an **extra 2 months free** on top of those offers.
- Executive plan: often recommended with the 2-year pay-in-full option as the **absolute best value**.
- A short note that early cancellations may incur a catch-up fee for free months already used (don’t get too legalistic, just mention it simply).

Layout & sections (in this order):

1. **Hero section (above the fold)**  
   - Bold headline:  
     “Set Your Yard to Mission-Ready and Forget About It.”  
   - Subheadline:  
     “Lawn Trooper keeps your yard trimmed, clean, and sharp all season with simple, predictable subscription plans.”  
   - Big CTA button: “Get My Custom Yard Quote” (scrolls to form).  
   - Secondary CTA: “See Plans & Pricing” (scrolls to pricing section).  
   - Background: clean hero illustration or gradient using brand colors (no stock image URLs, just placeholder section styling).

2. **How It Works (3 simple steps)**  
   Example steps:
   - Step 1: “Choose your plan & yard size”  
   - Step 2: “We ‘deploy’ your Lawn Trooper crew”  
   - Step 3: “Enjoy an always-ready yard with auto-scheduled visits”

3. **Plans & Pricing Section**  
   - Three cards: Basic Patrol, Premium Command, Executive Deployment.  
   - Each card:
     - Short tagline (e.g., “Solid weekly protection for your yard”).
     - List features.
     - Note that price shows **“Starting at $X/mo for up to 1/4 acre”** with a line beneath like “Larger lots: we’ll give you a fast custom quote.”
     - Highlight Executive card visually as “Most Popular” or “Best Value”.
   - Under the cards, a small text note:  
     “All plans billed monthly. 1-year and 2-year options with up to 3 free months + 2 extra months free when you pay in full. Executive plan waives the install fee on 2-year agreements.”

4. **Why Lawn Trooper? (Trust & proof)**  
   Short bullets such as:
   - “Locally owned, not a faceless national chain.”
   - “Tech-forward: smart routing, robotic mowers where appropriate.”
   - “Consistent crews so you know who’s in your yard.”
   - “Mission mindset: we treat every yard like an assignment we have to complete with excellence.”
   You can include a small “testimonial-style” quote placeholder, like:  
   “My yard has never looked this consistently good. I don’t even think about mowing anymore.” — Happy Customer

5. **Promotions Banner**  
   A visually distinct band across the page, summarizing the promos:
   - “Sign a 1-year agreement: 1 month free.”
   - “Sign a 2-year agreement: 3 months free + waived install on Executive.”
   - “Pay in full: extra 2 months free.”
   Make it feel urgent but not pushy: e.g., “Founding Customer Offer – Available for a Limited Time.”

6. **FAQ Section**  
   A few simple questions:
   - “How do you bill me?”  
   - “What if my yard is bigger than 1/4 acre?”  
   - “What happens if I move or need to cancel early?”  
   - “Do you use robotic mowers?”  
   Keep each answer 1–3 sentences, clear and reassuring.

Deliverable:

- Make the design visually appealing but simple enough for a non-coder to tweak text and numbers later.
