You are working inside the Lawn Trooper Replit codebase.

IMPORTANT:
- I may have other edits in this workspace. Do NOT revert unrelated changes.
- Do NOT refactor the entire wizard architecture.
- Preserve the wizard steps and routing: Step 1 Yard Size → Step 2 Plan → Step 3 Upgrades → Step 4 Contact.
- Goal is correctness + clarity, not a giant redesign.

PRIMARY GOAL:
Fix plan consistency and the quote wizard logic so the site matches the intended plan structure and stops confusing customers.

PLAN PRICES + NAMES (LOCKED):
- Basic Patrol: $169/mo
- Premium Patrol: $299/mo
- Executive Command: $399/mo
- Executive+ is an OPTIONAL TOGGLE that appears ONLY when Executive is selected: +$99/mo

SLOT COUNTS (LOCKED):
- Basic Patrol: 2 Basic slots, 0 Premium slots
- Premium Patrol: 3 Basic slots, 1 Premium slot
- Executive Command: 3 Basic slots, 3 Premium slots
- Executive+ toggle adds: +1 Basic slot AND +1 Premium slot

CONVERSION RULE:
Allow “Convert 2 Basic → 1 Premium” ONLY for Premium and Executive.
Basic does NOT allow conversion.

TURF DEFENSE RULE (LOCKED):
- Basic: no turf apps included (do not show “2 apps” anywhere)
- Premium: no turf apps included by default
- Executive: show “Executive Turf Defense™ — up to 7 turf applications annually” + weed-free turf guarantee language.

LANDSCAPE ALLOWANCE (LOCKED, NO DOLLARS, NO YARD NUMBERS):
- Premium: “Seasonal Landscape Refresh Allowance™”
- Executive: “Premier Landscape Allowance™”
- Executive+: “Expanded Landscape Allowance™”
Add tooltip/helper text anywhere it appears:
“An included allowance you can apply toward mulch/pine straw refreshes, bed enhancements, pruning upgrades, and cleanups. Resets annually. Specialty materials may require additional upgrade.”
Do NOT show yard counts or dollar amounts publicly.

STEP 1 CLEANUP:
Fix yard size cards so there is no duplicate line. Display only:
- Small: Up to 1/3 acre
- Medium: 1/3 – 2/3 acre
- Large: 2/3 – 1 acre

STEP 2 CONSISTENCY FIX:
Right now the plan comparison table/card/features show conflicting numbers.
Create/identify ONE “plan config” source of truth (object or file) and make:
- Step 2 comparison table
- plan cards
- plan features panels
- Step 3 counters and validation
all read from that shared plan config.
This should eliminate mismatched counts like “Upgrades Included 3/5/6” vs “3 basic + 0 premium” vs “2 basic included.”

STEP 3 ENFORCEMENT:
Ensure Step 3 starts with required slots (or defaults if you already have them) and cannot proceed unless:
- Basic has 2 Basic selected
- Premium has 3 Basic + 1 Premium (or conversion-adjusted totals)
- Executive has 3 Basic + 3 Premium (or conversion-adjusted totals)
Also ensure the Executive+ toggle correctly increases slot counts and total price.

EXECUTIVE+ TOGGLE:
When Executive is selected, show:
“Executive+ Upgrade (+$99/mo)”
If enabled:
- Adds +1 Basic slot, +1 Premium slot
- Adds locked perks: Quarterly Strategy Session + Rapid Response Priority
- Changes allowance label to Expanded Landscape Allowance™ in summaries

OUTPUT:
After implementing, provide:
- List of files changed
- Short explanation of the plan config structure (where it lives)
- A test checklist (click-through steps)
- Confirm no console errors

DO NOT in this pass:
- rewrite all marketing copy
- redesign the entire UI
- add new paid add-on mechanisms
Just fix correctness + slot logic + consistency + allowance wording.
