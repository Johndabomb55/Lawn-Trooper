You are a senior software product engineer + conversion-focused marketer.

Mission:
Turn Lawn-Trooper.com into a premium lead-generation + “playable” quote experience that:
1) Clearly states: NO payment is required at any point, and we do NOT sell data (we only use it to schedule the FREE Dream Yard Recon).
2) Shows dynamic promotions and savings in a fun, rewarding way, without exposing internal pricing logic.
3) Encourages exploration (“reward those who play with options”), nudges toward higher-value plans/add-ons, and still makes Basic feel like an amazing value.
4) Implements a stacking promotions engine (all promos stack, subject to caps) and removes the obsolete “pay-in-full extra 2 months free” offer everywhere.

DO NOT:
- Change base plan pricing or add-on pricing logic.
- Remove existing validation.
- Add heavy libraries.
- Break mobile responsiveness.
- Introduce horizontal scrolling.
- Leak internal formulas or pricing rules beyond what the UI already shows (monthly total and savings summary are fine; do NOT show internal multipliers, hidden margins, etc.)

IMPORTANT POLICY:
All free months are delivered at the END of the agreement term, and all promotions can stack unless capped (see below).

------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 0 — READ-ONLY AUDIT (NO CODE CHANGES YET)
------------------------------------------------------------
Before modifying anything:
A) Identify the single quote flow component(s) (the multi-step form) and the final submit handler.
B) Confirm where plan tiers, add-ons, and promotions are currently defined.
C) Provide a short plan with the exact file list you will modify.
STOP and ask me if anything is still unclear.

------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 1 — TRUST + COMPLIANCE (HIGH PRIORITY)
------------------------------------------------------------
Add trust messaging in 3 places (no new page required):
1) Near the primary CTA / top of the quote form:
   - “No payment required. This is a FREE Dream Yard Recon request.”
2) On the Contact step, directly above fields:
   - “No payment required. We never sell your data. We only use this to contact you to schedule your FREE Dream Yard Recon.”
3) On the confirmation screen:
   - Repeat the above + a short privacy note.

Keep it premium and military tone. Add a tagline where appropriate:
   - “Commit to us and we commit to you.”

------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 2 — PROMOTIONS ENGINE (CONFIG-DRIVEN + SAFE)
------------------------------------------------------------
Create a centralized promotions config file (e.g., /config/promotions.json or promotions.ts) with:
- id, title, shortDescription, eligibilityRules, stackGroup, maxStackCount, appliesTo (term/prepay/segment/referral/earlyBird), and “freeMonthsAtEnd” or “percentOff”.
- Include every deal currently marketed on the website except the obsolete “pay-in-full extra 2 months free,” which must be removed from code and UI.
- Examples:
  • 2-Year Pact Early Bird: 3 free months (stackGroup: termFreeMonths, freeMonthsAtEnd: 3)
  • 1-Year Pact Early Bird: 1 free month (termFreeMonths, freeMonthsAtEnd: 1)
  • Renters Discount: 5% off (stackGroup: percentOff)
  • Pay Upfront 2-Year: 15% off (percentOff)
  • Pay Upfront 1-Year: 10% off (percentOff)
  • Veterans Discount: 5% off (percentOff)
  • Seniors Discount: 5% off (percentOff)
  • Referral Bonus: 1 free month for both parties (applied after referred customer commits)
- Remove any mention of “pay-in-full: extra 2 months free.”
- Enforce a hard cap: max 30% total discount AND max 3 free months from stacking (match current marketing promise).
- Define stacking logic explicitly (e.g., Early Bird free months can stack with Prepay % off, but if cap exceeded, reduce the last-applied benefit first in a predictable order).
- If renter/veteran/senior discounts push past cap, clamp to cap and show “Cap applied” tooltip.

Implement:
- A pure function: getApplicablePromotions(userSelections, nowDate) -> { eligible[], applied[], savingsBreakdown, capApplied }
- A pure function: applyPromotions(baseTotals, appliedPromotions) -> { displayedMonthly, displayedEffectiveMonthly, freeMonthsAtEnd, percentSavings, annualSavingsEstimate }
- Note: The Referral Bonus should be shown as a potential free month (e.g., “+1 free month after your referred friend commits”) but not included in the effective monthly calculation until the referral is validated.

------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 3 — LIVE SAVINGS UI (MAKE IT FUN, MAKE IT CLEAR)
------------------------------------------------------------
In the quote flow, add a “Savings & Promotions” panel that updates on EVERY choice:
- Show: “Monthly Total” (current), “Effective Monthly” (after term/free months), “You Save” (monthly and total over term), “Free Months” (at end), and “Why you got this” (applied promos list).
- Add a small “Rewards” indicator:
  - “Discount Unlocked!” banner + subtle confetti burst when a new promo becomes applied.
  - Outline glow around the applied promo card for 1 second.

Add a “Commit to us and we commit to you” line where it naturally fits:
- Place it near the contract-term selector or promotions panel.
- Keep tone premium, not cheesy.

------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 4 — CONTROLLED UPSELL (ETHICAL + EFFECTIVE)
------------------------------------------------------------
Goal: Encourage Premium/Executive and additional add-ons without being pushy.

Implement:
1) Plan Tier step:
   - Add “Value Highlights” for Premium/Executive (3 bullets max) and a subtle “Most Popular” badge for Premium.
   - Show “Upgrade impact” line: “Upgrade to Premium for about +$X/mo after your current discounts” (computed; no internal formula shown).
2) Add-ons step:
   - Keep required add-on guidance visible (“Loadout required: X Basic + Y Premium”).
   - When user completes requirements, show: “Loadout Complete — add more services to unlock more savings/value” (if any promo supports it).
   - Add “Recommended add-ons” section (max 3) based on plan tier + season (simple mapping in config).
3) Reward exploration:
   - If user spends time toggling options, occasionally show a small “Nice — you found a better value combo” toast (rate-limited).

------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 5 — GAMIFICATION (LIGHTWEIGHT)
------------------------------------------------------------
Add subtle gamification (must be fast, non-blocking):
- Step labels: Recruit → Specialist → Sergeant → Commander.
- Checkmark pulse on step completion.
- Confetti only when a promotion is newly unlocked or when form is submitted successfully.

------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 6 — SUBMISSION + CONFIRMATION (LEAD GEN)
------------------------------------------------------------
On submit:
- Capture selected plan, yard size, add-ons, applied promos, savings summary, contact info.
- Send to /api/leads (or existing endpoint) as structured JSON.
- Do NOT process payment.

Confirmation screen:
- “Mission Accomplished” headline.
- Summary of selections + promotions applied.
- Repeat: no payment required, data not sold.
- Add note: “We will contact you via your preferred method (call, email, or text) to schedule your FREE Dream Yard Recon. If you don’t attach yard photos, we’ll send Miguel to scout your property — no commitment needed.”
- Add waitlist CTA:  
  “Join Priority Waitlist for Lawn Trooper Elite (Launching Spring 2026)” (email only; optional)
- Add referral nudge:  
  “Refer a neighbour — you both get 1 month free (applied after your friend commits).”

------------------------------------------------------------
PERFORMANCE + MAINTAINABILITY REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------
- No horizontal scroll at any viewport.
- Promotions, add-ons, plan highlights, seasonal recommendations stored in config files (easy to edit later).
- Code organized into components:
  QuoteWizard, PromotionsPanel, SavingsPanel, AddOnSummary, Confirmation.
- Add feature flags:
  enableGamification, enableWaitlist, enablePromoConfetti
- Add a short README section: “How to update promotions, plan tiers, and add-ons safely”.

------------------------------------------------------------
DELIVERABLES
------------------------------------------------------------
1) PLAN + file list
2) Diffs grouped by phase
3) Manual test checklist (desktop + mobile)
4) Confirm: base pricing logic unchanged; obsolete pay-in-full free-month promotion removed everywhere
5) Ask me any last clarifications needed before coding
