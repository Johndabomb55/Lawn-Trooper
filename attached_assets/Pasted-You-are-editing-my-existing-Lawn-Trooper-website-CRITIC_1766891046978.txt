You are editing my existing Lawn Trooper website. CRITICAL: Do NOT delete, rewrite, or remove ANY existing services, add-ons, plan descriptions, promotions, pricing notes, FAQs, policies, or copy. Preserve every item exactly as-is unless I explicitly ask otherwise.

Goal:
Replace the current 3 separate scrolling plan boxes with ONE single “Plan Builder” box that dynamically changes based on user selections:
1) Yard Size: 1/3 acre, 2/3 acre, 1 acre
2) Plan Tier: Basic, Premium, Executive
3) Add-ons: show only the allowed add-ons for the selected tier (Basic add-ons for Basic plan only; Premium/Executive can see Premium add-ons)

Requirements:
- Keep ALL existing services and add-ons (same names, same descriptions, same categories, same pricing). Do not invent or remove items.
- The new Plan Builder must simply DISPLAY existing plan/service/add-on data dynamically rather than having three separate boxes.
- Keep the rest of the page layout unchanged as much as possible.
- Preserve existing styling, branding, spacing, colors, fonts, and buttons unless required for the Plan Builder to work.

Plan Builder behavior:
A) Basic tier:
- Shows Basic plan inclusions for the selected yard size
- Allows selecting ONLY Basic add-ons
- Include count rules: Basic gets exactly 1 Basic add-on included (if that is the current rule on the site).

B) Premium tier:
- Shows Premium plan inclusions for selected yard size
- Allows selecting: 1 Basic add-on included + 2 Premium add-ons included (if current rule).
- Premium add-ons list only appears when Premium is selected.

C) Executive tier:
- Shows Executive plan inclusions for selected yard size
- Allows selecting: 1 Basic add-on included + 3 Premium add-ons included (if current rule).
- Executive shows “Top Priority Scheduling” messaging.

Pricing:
- Use my current base prices:
  Basic: $169/month for 1/3 acre
  Premium: $299/month for 1/3 acre
  Executive: $399/month for 1/3 acre
- Apply a 25% increase per additional 1/3 acre:
  2/3 acre = 1/3 price * 1.25 (rounded to nearest whole dollar)
  1 acre = 2/3 price * 1.25 (rounded)
- Add-on pricing rules:
  - Keep existing add-on prices exactly as-is.
  - If my site currently includes certain add-ons “free/included” by tier, keep that rule.
  - If a customer selects add-ons beyond what is included in the plan, add the extra cost accordingly.
  - Show a line-item summary: Base Plan + Included Add-ons + Paid Add-ons + Total Monthly Price.

Service Method disclaimer:
Add this text (verbatim) somewhere subtle under the Plan Builder (small text):
“Service Method Disclaimer
Lawn Trooper utilizes a combination of advanced lawn care technologies and professional equipment to deliver consistent, high-quality results.
You are paying for results. Lawn Trooper assesses the property, selects the appropriate service method, and executes the mission to maintain your yard at the highest standard.”

Data preservation:
- IMPORTANT: Do NOT retype my services/add-ons manually.
- Instead, refactor the code so ALL existing services/add-ons are defined once in structured data (arrays/objects) and rendered dynamically.
- If my existing code already lists services/add-ons in HTML, migrate them into structured data WITHOUT CHANGING THE TEXT.

Technical approach:
- Create a single PlanBuilder component/section.
- Create data objects:
  - yardSizes = ["1/3", "2/3", "1"]
  - plans = { Basic: {...}, Premium: {...}, Executive: {...} }
  - addOns = { basic: [...], premium: [...] }
- Render inclusions as checkmarked lists.
- Enforce add-on selection limits by tier with live remaining-counter text:
  “Basic add-ons remaining: X”
  “Premium add-ons remaining: Y”
- Keep mobile friendly layout.

Safety step:
- Before making changes, create a backup copy of the current file(s) being edited (duplicate or git commit).
- Then implement changes.

Deliverable:
- Updated site with ONE dynamic plan builder box.
- No lost services, add-ons, or copy.
