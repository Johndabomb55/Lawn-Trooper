all terminology for the sale needs to be changed to ending march 25th.  including act by march 25 etc. also the sign up by feb needs to be changed to march 25 scan the whole site and make sure its not confusing.
Copy
Summary
Updated all sale deadline terminology to March 25 in promo config and labels, including changing remaining “Feb Promo” wording to “March Promo” and aligning promo logic comments accordingly.

Updated homepage sale messaging so “Act by” and “Sign Up By” now both point to March 25, and standardized the sale-end banner language to March 25 as requested.

Scanned the app source for sale-related date terms to ensure no conflicting January/February sale messaging remained in the user-facing sale copy.

stage commit and push to github
Copy
Done what I could from this environment:

I staged everything with git add -A (no pending changes).

I attempted to create a commit, but Git reported the working tree is already clean.

I attempted to push, but this repo has no configured remote.

Checks run
✅ git status -sb && git branch -vv && git remote -v

✅ git add -A && git commit -m "chore: finalize sale messaging updates" (result: nothing to commit, working tree clean)

⚠️ git push (failed because no remote push destination is configured)

To complete push, add a remote and run push, e.g.:

git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
git push -u origin work
https://github.com/Johndabomb55/Lawn-Trooper.git
Copy
I set the GitHub remote and attempted to push the branch, but push is blocked by this environment’s network/proxy.

What I ran
✅ git remote -v && git remote add origin https://github.com/Johndabomb55/Lawn-Trooper.git && git remote -v

⚠️ git push -u origin work (failed: CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403)

If you run the same push command from your local machine (or a network with GitHub access), it should publish the existing work branch and commits:

git push -u origin work
git push -u origin work
Copy
I ran it exactly as requested, but this environment still can’t reach GitHub due to a proxy/network block.

Command run

⚠️ git push -u origin work (failed: CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403)

Remote is configured correctly to your repo, so the same command should work from a network with GitHub access.
