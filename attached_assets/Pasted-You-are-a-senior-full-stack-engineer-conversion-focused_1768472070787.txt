You are a senior full-stack engineer + conversion-focused web designer. Build a brand-new website from scratch for Lawn Trooper (North Alabama lawn care). The goal is to generate leads and close customers fast. The #1 focus is an interactive “Dream Yard Recon / Plan Picker” tool that produces a simple quote estimate and captures contact info.

Hard requirements:
1) Build as a single-page modern site with the Plan Picker as the hero section at the top.
2) Site must load fast, be mobile-first, and look premium but simple.
3) Keep words short and clear. Big buttons. Minimal scrolling before the picker.
4) Do not use paid APIs or services. Use only free libraries.
5) Provide clean, readable code and comments.

Tech requirements:
- Use a simple stack that runs easily on Replit. Prefer: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.
- No database required. Store leads by sending an email OR writing to a simple local JSON file OR a lightweight server endpoint that saves to a file (choose the simplest reliable option).
- Include basic form validation and spam prevention (honeypot field).
- Include a /health route if you use a backend.
- Include instructions in README.md on how to run + deploy in Replit.

Brand & messaging requirements (use throughout):
- Business: Lawn Trooper (say “lawn dash trooper dot com” only if used in voice script; otherwise display lawn-trooper.com normally)
- Trust signals: “25th anniversary serving North Alabama” and “100+ beautification awards”
- Value proposition: Premium service at honest prices. Mention electric equipment for reduced noise and cleaner operation + new tech in 2026 lowering costs and passing savings to customers.
- Primary CTA: “Get your free Dream Yard Recon”
- Secondary CTA: “Text us” and “Call us” buttons (use placeholder phone number variable).
- Include “party with a purpose” vibe is NOT needed here; keep Lawn Trooper professional, friendly, confident.

Information architecture:
A) Sticky header with: Plans, Picker, Reviews, FAQs, Contact.
B) Hero section: headline + subheadline + 2 buttons + the Plan Picker card embedded.
C) Trust bar under hero: 25 years, 100+ awards, electric equipment, honest prices.
D) Plans section: 3 tiers (Basic / Plus / Premium) with short bullet points and “Select in Picker” buttons.
E) Reviews section: 6 placeholders (no fake names that look real; use “Verified Customer” + star rating placeholders).
F) FAQ section: licensing/insurance question (answer generically: “We are properly insured for the work we perform. Ask us for proof any time.” Don’t give legal advice.)
G) Service area: list key towns in North Alabama as placeholders.
H) Final CTA section + Contact form.

Plan Picker tool requirements (MAIN FEATURE):
- Title: “Dream Yard Recon — Plan & Price Picker”
- User inputs:
  1) Property size (choices): up to 1/4 acre, 1/4–1/2, 1/2–3/4, 3/4–1 acre, 1–1.5, 1.5–2
  2) Mowing frequency: biweekly, weekly
  3) Plan level: Basic / Plus / Premium
  4) Add-ons (checkboxes): weed control, edging upgrade, shrub trimming, mulch, leaf cleanup, pre-emergent
  5) Start timing: ASAP / next month / just researching
- Output:
  - Show an estimated monthly range (low–high) based on a simple transparent formula.
  - Show what’s included (bullets) based on plan selection.
  - Show next step CTA: “Get My Free Recon” which opens a lead capture modal.

Pricing logic (make it easy to edit in one file):
- Use a config object that defines base prices by property size for Basic at biweekly.
- Weekly adds a multiplier (example: 1.35).
- Plus adds +$X, Premium adds +$Y (set reasonable placeholder numbers).
- Add-ons add fixed monthly amounts (some can be seasonal, but keep simple).
- Output range: +/- 10% to avoid “exact quote” claims.
- Display disclaimer: “Final price confirmed after your free Dream Yard Recon.”

Lead capture:
- Modal form fields: name, phone, email, address (optional), notes.
- Include hidden honeypot field.
- On submit:
  - Save the lead with timestamp + the user’s picker selections + estimated range.
  - Show success screen: “We’ll reach out within 1 business day.”
- Provide a simple admin view route (/admin) protected by a basic password env var to display saved leads (table view). Keep it simple.

Accessibility & polish:
- Keyboard accessible modal
- Clear focus states
- Good contrast
- Mobile friendly spacing
- Smooth scroll navigation
- Basic SEO: title, meta description, OpenGraph placeholders, sitemap.xml, robots.txt

Deliverables:
1) Working site with the Plan Picker as the main focus
2) Clean code + config-driven pricing
3) README with setup instructions
4) Notes at bottom: where to edit prices, towns, phone number, and copy

Start by scaffolding the project, then implement page sections, then implement picker logic, then lead capture and saving, then admin page. Ensure everything runs successfully in Replit.
