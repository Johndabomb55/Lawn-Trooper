You are editing my EXISTING Lawn Trooper website in Replit. Do NOT redesign the site. Do NOT change the overall layout, branding, or flow. Your job is to update plan + add-on content site-wide so it matches the SOURCE OF TRUTH below, and remove/replace anything that conflicts. Be thorough, professional, and consistent across the entire website.

SCOPE (must update everywhere this appears):
- Pricing page / plan cards / comparison table
- Any “Plans” sections on home page and subpages
- FAQs, tooltips, popups, marketing blurbs, and checkout/quote flow text
- Any plan summaries used in forms, emails, confirmation screens, or modals
- Any duplicated plan text in multiple components
- Any “Add-ons” page/section, add-on selectors, and add-on descriptions
- Any images/captions or UI labels that mention plan features (update text only)

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:
Centralize ALL plan and add-on content into a single shared data source (one config/object/module) and render the plan cards, comparisons, and add-on lists from that source. This prevents the site from drifting again.

========================
SOURCE OF TRUTH (FINAL)
========================

PLAN NAMES (use exactly):
- Basic Patrol
- Premium Patrol
- Executive Patrol

GLOBAL PLAN PROMISE (all plans):
- Every visit includes: Precision edging / Detailed trimming / Blowing of all turf & hard surfaces for clean curb appeal.

YARD ELIGIBILITY (must be stated clearly on pricing/plan area):
- These neighborhood plan prices are for yards UNDER 1 acre.
- For country properties or yards OVER 1 acre: request a custom estimate (send pictures) and we will provide a detailed custom quote.

LEAF SERVICE WORDING (replace “full/unlimited leaves” everywhere):
- Leaf Service (Fall & Winter months):
  - Basic Patrol: Monthly leaf cleanup — Leaf blowing / Mulching / Removal
  - Premium Patrol: Bi-weekly leaf cleanup — Leaf blowing / Mulching / Removal
  - Executive Patrol: Bi-weekly leaf cleanup — Leaf blowing / Mulching / Removal
Use slashes. Do NOT use “Unlimited” or “Full leaf cleanup” anywhere.

BUSH TRIMMING RULE (IMPORTANT: add this disposal line EVERY time bush trimming is mentioned):
- Whenever bush trimming is listed (plan or add-on), include:
  “All clippings removed and disposed for clean curb appeal and pristine flower beds.”
This must appear in plan bullets AND in the add-on description for Extra Bush Trimming.

PRICING (marketing markdown for anniversary sale; show on pricing cards):
- Basic Patrol: $129/month (was $169/month)
- Premium Patrol: $199/month (was $279/month)
- Executive Patrol: $299/month (was $399/month)
Add a small note: “25+ Year Anniversary Pricing + AI Savings” (professional tone).

AI SAVINGS MESSAGE (keep tasteful; do not overclaim):
- We are lowering costs with new AI + 2026 technology and passing savings on to customers.

COMMITMENT MESSAGE (military-style but professional):
- “If you commit to us, we commit to you.”

SIGN-UP / CONSULTATION / REFUND (must be explained clearly near checkout or FAQ):
- After the first month is paid, schedule a consultation + walkthrough (virtual or in-person).
- At the time of the consultation, if the customer decides it’s not the right fit, provide a full refund.
Keep language professional and clear.

FREE MONTHS + INCENTIVES (must be included in promo area; do not say “first month free”):
- 1-year term: 1 free month at the END of the term
- 2-year term: 3 free months at the END of the term
- “Visit our discounts page to stack incentives for up to 35% off + free months at the end of your term.”
Do NOT mention paying upfront specifically; keep it as “stack incentives” as written.

EXISTING CUSTOMER LOYALTY (must be included in promo/FAQ):
- “Existing customers: Happy Holidays — log in, select your 2026 plan, and apply your loyalty discount.”

EXECUTIVE BONUS ADD-ON PROMO:
- Executive includes 2 Basic Add-Ons + 3 Premium Add-Ons.
- Limited-time: enroll before January 1, 2026 to receive +1 Premium Add-On at no additional cost (total Premium add-ons becomes 4).
Implement this with a single promo flag/date check that is easy to turn off later.
