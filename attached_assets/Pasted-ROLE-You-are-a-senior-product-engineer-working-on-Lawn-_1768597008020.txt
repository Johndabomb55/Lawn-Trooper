ROLE:
You are a senior product engineer working on Lawn Trooper’s live subscription website (lawn-trooper.com).
RETROFIT ONLY. Do not redesign the site or change its overall look/branding. Implement the rules below exactly, fix confusing wording, and ensure pricing updates correctly after every click.

GOAL:
1) Make commitment + bonuses crystal clear (premium tone, not salesy).
2) Keep month-to-month = 0 free months (we reward commitment).
3) Ensure “free months” are SKIPPED BILLING MONTHS at the end of the term (term still ends on 12/24-month anniversary).
4) Update add-on catalog copy + structure (pressure wash bundle, fertilizer included in 3-app add-on, lighting, mulch, etc.).
5) Replace the “weekly growing-season mowing” basic add-on concept with a more sustainable “Growing-Season Boost” that does NOT undercut Premium/Executive.
6) Fix form submission (it was failing) and test it end-to-end.

========================================
A) CORE DEFINITIONS (NON-NEGOTIABLE COPY)
========================================
- “Complimentary months” = skipped billing months applied at the end of your term.
- The agreement still ends exactly on the 12-month or 24-month anniversary date.
Use this exact disclaimer in Step 5 and final summary:
“Complimentary months are skipped billing months applied at the end of your term. Your agreement still ends on your 12-month or 24-month anniversary date.”

========================================
B) COMMITMENT OPTIONS (MUST SHOW ALL 3)
========================================
Show and support these commitment options everywhere:
1) Month-to-Month
   - +15% flexibility premium applied to the entire subscription (plan + add-ons)
   - ZERO complimentary months
   - Copy must state:
     “Month-to-month does not include complimentary months because we reward long-term commitment.”

2) 1-Year Subscription
   - Commitment Bonus: +1 complimentary month

3) 2-Year Subscription (Price Lock) (featured)
   - Commitment Bonus: +2 complimentary months
   - “Price Lock” label

========================================
C) PAY-IN-FULL TOGGLE (NOT PAYMENT METHOD)
========================================
- Remove “How do you want to pay?” buttons if they still exist as separate payment methods.
- Pay in Full is a toggle under 1-Year and 2-Year.
Rule:
- Pay in Full DOUBLES COMMITMENT BONUS ONLY.
- Enrollment bonus months are NOT doubled.
So:
- 1-Year PIF => 2 commitment months
- 2-Year PIF => 4 commitment months

========================================
D) TWO BONUSES MUST BE SEPARATE IN UI
========================================
There are TWO distinct bonuses:
1) Commitment Bonus (always on): 1-year = 1 month, 2-year = 2 months (doubled if Pay in Full).
2) 25-Year Birthday Bonus (Enrollment Bonus): time-based and NOT doubled.

UI requirement:
- In Step 5 (commitment step), show them as separate line items:
  “Commitment Bonus”
  “25-Year Birthday Bonus (Enrollment Bonus)”
Do NOT display a single “+3 months” badge without the breakdown.

========================================
E) 25-YEAR BIRTHDAY BONUS (PHASED)
========================================
Name: “25-Year Birthday Bonus”
This is the enrollment bonus and should be introduced on the main page in a premium way (no numbers shouted).
Homepage/hero line (small but noticeable):
“Celebrating 25 years — long-term subscribers may qualify for our 25-Year Birthday Bonus.”

In Step 5, show the actual schedule:
- Enroll by Jan 25: +2 bonus months
- Enroll by Feb 25: +1 bonus month
- After Feb 25: +0 (Bonus concluded)
Keep the same name across phases (do not rename).

========================================
F) MATH (MUST BE CORRECT)
========================================
Definitions:
- termMonths = 12 or 24
- commitmentFreeMonths = 1 or 2
- payInFullMultiplier = 1 or 2 (applies to commitment months only)
- birthdayBonusMonths = 0 / 1 / 2 (based on enrollment window)
TotalFreeMonths =
  (commitmentFreeMonths * payInFullMultiplier) + birthdayBonusMonths

BilledMonths = termMonths - totalFreeMonths

EffectiveMonthly (display only):
effectiveMonthly = (monthlySubscription * billedMonths) / termMonths
Rules:
- effectiveMonthly must ALWAYS be <= monthlySubscription
- no fractional months
- savings comparisons must use Month-to-Month baseline (includes +15%)

Also ensure the “vs month-to-month” comparison uses the month-to-month premium price (not base monthly).

========================================
G) PLAN COPY CONSISTENCY (MATCH EVERYWHERE)
========================================
Ensure plan cards, plan picker, summary, and any “Choose your perfect plan” section all match and do not drift.
