RETROFIT ONLY. Do not redesign or rebuild.

GOAL:
Delete “How do you want to pay?” buttons and implement a commitment-first subscription model with a 2-year price lock and Pay-in-Full bonus.

====================================
A) REMOVE PAYMENT METHOD UI
====================================
1) Completely remove:
- Monthly / Yearly / Pay in Full payment buttons
- Any pricing logic tied to those buttons

====================================
B) COMMITMENT OPTIONS
====================================
2) Implement ONLY these options:

**Month-to-Month Subscription**
- Apply +15% premium to total subscription (plan + add-ons)
- No free months
- Cancel anytime

**2-Year Subscription (Price Lock)**
- Term = 24 months
- Base free months = 2

====================================
C) PAY-IN-FULL BONUS (2-YEAR ONLY)
====================================
3) Add a toggle under the 2-Year option:
- Label: “Pay in Full (Best Value)”

4) Pay-in-Full behavior:
- Doubles base free months
- 2-Year base = 2 → Pay in Full = 4 free months

5) Early Bonus (campaign-based):
- If signup date < Jan 25:
  +1 free month
- Max free months = 5

====================================
D) BILLING & MATH
====================================
6) Calculate:
- freeMonths = 2 (+2 if Pay in Full) (+1 if Early Bonus)
- billedMonths = 24 − freeMonths

7) Pay-in-Full total:
- totalDueNow = monthlySubscription × billedMonths

8) Effective monthly:
effectiveMonthly = (monthlySubscription × billedMonths) ÷ 24
- Must always be ≤ monthlySubscription

====================================
E) UI REQUIREMENTS
====================================
9) Show clearly:
- Monthly subscription price
- Free months earned
- Billed vs total months
- Effective monthly
- Total savings vs Month-to-Month

10) Highlight Pay-in-Full:
- Badge: “Best Value”
- Copy: “Pay in full and unlock maximum savings.”

====================================
F) CLEANUP & TESTING
====================================
11) Remove legacy pricing comparisons.
12) Test:
- Month-to-Month = base × 1.15
- 2-Year Monthly = base × 22/24
- 2-Year Pay-in-Full = base × 20/24
- 2-Year Pay-in-Full + Early Bonus = base × 19/24

Confirm consistency across:
- Plan picker
- Commitment step
- Summary step
- Savings display
