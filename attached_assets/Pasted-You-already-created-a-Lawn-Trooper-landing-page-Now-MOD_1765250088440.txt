You already created a Lawn Trooper landing page. 

Now MODIFY the EXISTING PAGE (do not rebuild from scratch) with the following updates and rules. Keep the general layout, copy style, colors, hero section, pricing, and contact-method validation you already implemented, but adjust and extend it as described below.

────────────────
1) CONTACT + ADDRESS LOGIC (KEEP / CONFIRM)
────────────────
Keep or enforce this behavior in the quote form:

- REQUIRED:
  - Name
  - Full Street Address (include city & ZIP in one field)
  - Preferred contact method (Text, Phone call, Email, Either)
- CONDITIONAL REQUIRED:
  - If “Text” or “Phone call” is selected → Phone number is required.
  - If “Email” is selected → Email is required.
  - If “Either” is selected → at least **one** of phone OR email is required.
- OPTIONAL:
  - Yard photos (file input, accept="image/*", multiple).
  - Comments textarea.

Add a short helper line under the form saying:
“To give you a quote, all we really need is your address and a way to reach you. Photos are helpful but optional.”

Use simple vanilla JavaScript for validation and show friendly inline error messages if they try to submit without required fields.

────────────────
2) FAQ – CANCELLATION ANSWER (UPDATE)
────────────────
In the FAQ section, for the question:

“What happens if I move or need to cancel early?”

Make the answer say, clearly and simply:

“You can cancel any time. You’ll just forfeit the free months that were scheduled at the end of your agreement.”

Do NOT add extra legal language; keep it friendly and concise.

────────────────
3) PRICING REMINDER (KEEP / CONFIRM)
────────────────
Ensure pricing is clearly shown as starting prices for **up to 1/4 acre**:

- Basic Patrol: starting at **$129/mo** (up to 1/4 acre)
- Premium Command: starting at **$199/mo** (up to 1/4 acre)
- Executive Deployment: starting at **$299/mo** (up to 1/4 acre)

Below the pricing cards, keep a small note like:
“Prices shown are for up to 1/4 acre. Larger lots are no problem — we’ll measure and send a fast custom quote.”

────────────────
4) ADD AN EXPLICIT “PLAN SELECTION” CONTROL IN THE FORM
────────────────
Add a **required** “Choose Your Plan” section inside the quote form (not just as display in the pricing table).

Use **radio buttons** so the customer can only pick ONE plan:

- Basic Patrol
- Premium Command
- Executive Deployment

One of them must be selected before submitting the form.

This plan choice will control how many add-ons they can select in the next step.

────────────────
5) ADD-ONS LIST (BASIC & PREMIUM) WITH RULES
────────────────
Add a new section in the quote form labeled:

“Choose Your Add-Ons (Included in Your Plan)”

Under that, create two groups of checkboxes:

A) Basic Add-Ons (each Basic add-on costs 1 “slot”)
   Example items (you can format as a nice list):
   - Leaf cleanup (basic)
   - Light shrub trim
   - Simple bed tidy-up
   - One-time extra mow
   - Simple sidewalk/driveway blow-off

B) Premium Add-Ons (each Premium add-on costs 2 “slots”)
   Example items:
   - Deep seasonal cleanup
   - Mulch refresh (beds only)
   - Hedge shaping (front yard)
   - Heavy leaf removal
   - Flower bed detail service

You may adjust labels slightly for clarity, but keep a clear “Basic” vs “Premium” grouping with headings.

Add a short explanatory line above the lists, like:
“Basic add-ons cost 1 slot. Premium add-ons cost 2 slots. Your plan includes a certain number of slots you can use on Basic or Premium add-ons.”

────────────────
6) PLAN → ADD-ON LIMITS & TRADE RULES (IMPORTANT)
────────────────
Use JavaScript to enforce how many add-ons they can pick based on the selected plan.

Slot system:
- Each Basic add-on = 1 slot.
- Each Premium add-on = 2 slots.

Plan entitlements (in slots):

- Basic Patrol:
  - Includes **2 Basic add-ons**.
  - NO trading and NO Premium add-ons.
  - Implementation:
    - Allow up to **2 Basic** add-ons (2 slots).
    - Disable Premium add-on checkboxes (greyed out / not clickable).
    - Show a note under the Basic plan selection like:
      “Basic Patrol includes up to 2 Basic add-ons.”

- Premium Command:
  - Default entitlement: 2 Basic + 3 Premium.
  - That equals **8 slots total** (2×1 + 3×2 = 2 + 6 = 8).
  - They ARE allowed to trade 2 Basics for 1 Premium or vice versa.
  - Implementation:
    - For Premium Command, allow Basic and Premium checkboxes.
    - Enforce rule: `basicCount * 1 + premiumCount * 2 <= 8` slots.
    - If the user tries to check an add-on that would exceed 8 slots, prevent that checkbox from being checked and show a small message like “You’ve selected the maximum add-ons included with your plan.”

- Executive Deployment:
  - Default entitlement: 2 Basic + 6 Premium.
  - That equals **14 slots total** (2×1 + 6×2 = 2 + 12 = 14).
  - They ARE allowed to trade 2 Basics for 1 Premium or vice versa.
  - Implementation:
    - For Executive Deployment, allow Basic and Premium checkboxes.
    - Enforce rule: `basicCount * 1 + premiumCount * 2 <= 14` slots.
    - Same behavior: block/check prevention if they exceed 14 slots with a friendly message.

This “slot” system automatically allows trading:
- 2 Basics (2 slots) ↔ 1 Premium (2 slots) for PREMIUM and EXECUTIVE only.
- BASIC plan has no trading and Premium checkboxes disabled, as required.

UI details:
- When a plan is selected, show a small text line under the add-ons area indicating:
  - “You can choose up to 2 Basic add-ons” (for Basic Patrol)
  - “You can choose up to 8 slots worth of add-ons (Basic = 1, Premium = 2)” (for Premium Command)
  - “You can choose up to 14 slots worth of add-ons (Basic = 1, Premium = 2)” (for Executive Deployment)
- Update this text dynamically when the user changes the plan selection.

Technical detail:
- Use vanilla JS to:
  - Listen for changes on the plan radio buttons.
  - Enable/disable Premium checkboxes when switching between Basic vs Premium/Executive.
  - On each checkbox change, recalculate:
    - `basicCount = number of checked Basic add-ons`
    - `premiumCount = number of checked Premium add-ons`
    - `totalSlots = basicCount + 2 * premiumCount`
  - If `totalSlots > allowedSlotsForPlan`, immediately undo that last checkbox change and display a small notice near the add-ons list (e.g., a span with error text).

────────────────
7) STYLE / DESIGN NOTES (KEEP / CONFIRM)
────────────────
- Keep the earth-tone color palette: deep army green, forest green, olive, tan, warm brown, off-white, with small accents of muted gold or brick red.
- Keep the large hero/logo concept:
  - Big “Lawn Trooper” title.
  - Placeholder hero area describing:
    - Cartoon Lawn Trooper character holding a weed eater like a rifle (not a weapon).
    - Realistic yard/home background with flowers, mulch, turf, and a robot mower.
- Make sure the logo/hero area remains visually prominent at the top.

────────────────
DELIVERABLE
────────────────
- Update the existing HTML/CSS/JS to include:
  - The required contact + address logic.
  - The updated FAQ cancellation answer.
  - The explicit plan selection radio buttons in the form.
  - The Add-ons section with Basic & Premium groups.
  - The JavaScript enforcement of add-on slot limits and trading rules based on plan.
