ROLE:
You are a senior product engineer improving Lawn Trooper’s live subscription website.
This is a RETROFIT. Do NOT redesign the site or change branding. Fix logic, restore missing options, correct copy, and ensure all math and UI behavior is correct and consistent.

========================================
A) CORE POSITIONING
========================================

1) Lawn Trooper is a SUBSCRIPTION lawn service.
2) Customers choose commitment length, not payment method.
3) Savings are earned through:
   - Commitment
   - Pay in full
   - Early enrollment
4) Language must be calm, premium, and non-salesy.

========================================
B) COMMITMENT OPTIONS (CRITICAL FIX)
========================================

5) Restore and clearly show THREE commitment options everywhere commitment is referenced:
   - Month-to-Month
   - 1-Year Subscription
   - 2-Year Subscription (Price Lock – featured)

6) Month-to-Month:
   - Apply +15% flexibility premium to the entire subscription (plan + add-ons)
   - No free months
   - Cancel anytime

7) 1-Year Subscription:
   - Base commitment bonus: +1 free month

8) 2-Year Subscription (Price Lock):
   - Base commitment bonus: +2 free months
   - Visually featured and labeled “Price Lock”

The 1-Year option MUST be visible, selectable, and fully functional.
Do not hide it or treat it as internal-only.

========================================
C) PAY-IN-FULL LOGIC (TOGGLE, NOT PAYMENT METHOD)
========================================

9) Remove ALL “How do you want to pay?” buttons.
   - No Monthly / Yearly / Pay in Full selectors.

10) Implement Pay in Full as a TOGGLE under:
    - 1-Year Subscription
    - 2-Year Subscription

11) Pay-in-Full rule:
    - Pay in Full DOUBLES COMMITMENT FREE MONTHS ONLY
    - Promotional/early bonus months are NOT doubled

Results:
- 1-Year Pay in Full → 2 free months
- 2-Year Pay in Full → 4 free months

========================================
D) 25TH ANNIVERSARY ENROLLMENT BONUS
========================================

12) Implement a time-based bonus named:
    “25th Anniversary Enrollment Bonus”

13) Bonus schedule:
    - Enroll Dec 25 → Jan 25 → +2 bonus free months
    - Enroll Jan 25 → Feb 25 → +1 bonus free month
    - Enroll after Feb 25 → +0 (promotion concluded)

Rules:
- Bonus months apply once
- Bonus months are NOT doubled
- Bonus months stack with commitment + pay-in-full

Maximum outcomes:
- 1-Year Pay in Full + Jan bonus → 3 free months
- 2-Year Pay in Full + Jan bonus → 6 free months

========================================
E) BILLING & SAVINGS MATH (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
========================================

14) Definitions:
    - termMonths = 12 or 24
    - freeMonths = commitment bonus + (pay-in-full multiplier) + (enrollment bonus)
    - billedMonths = termMonths − freeMonths

15) Pay-in-Full total:
    totalDueNow = monthlySubscription × billedMonths

16) Effective monthly (display only):
    effectiveMonthly = (monthlySubscription × billedMonths) ÷ termMonths

Rules:
- Effective monthly must ALWAYS be ≤ base monthly
- No fractional months
- Savings comparisons MUST use the Month-to-Month price (15% premium baseline)

========================================
F) PLAN COPY CONSISTENCY
========================================

17) Ensure plan cards, plan picker, summaries, and marketing sections ALL match the same source-of-truth copy.

- Bi-weekly mowing
- 2 weed treatments per year
