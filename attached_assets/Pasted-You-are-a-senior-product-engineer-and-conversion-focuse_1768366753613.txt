You are a senior product engineer and conversion-focused UX designer.

Context:
Lawn-trooper.com currently has a single multi-step “Get Your Instant Quote” form
(Yard Size → Plan Tier → Add-ons → Contact). Core logic and pricing already work.
DO NOT rebuild or move the form. This task is marketing, engagement, and polish only.

Primary Goal:
Increase form completion, enjoyment, memorability, and lead quality by adding
lightweight gamification, clarity, and feedback — without slowing the site
or changing pricing logic.

STRICT CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT change pricing calculations, plans, or add-on rules
- Do NOT remove existing validation
- Do NOT add heavy libraries
- Do NOT break mobile UX
- All changes must be additive and reversible
- Use existing styles, colors, and components where possible

TASKS
--------------------------------------------------

1) GAMIFIED PROGRESS BAR (LIGHTWEIGHT)
- Enhance the existing progress bar with rank labels:
  Step 1: Recruit
  Step 2: Specialist
  Step 3: Sergeant
  Step 4: Commander
- Display rank labels subtly under each icon.
- When a step is completed, briefly animate:
  - checkmark pulse OR
  - small confetti burst (CSS-only, <1s duration)
- Ensure animations are optional and do not block interaction.

2) ADD-ON STEP CLARITY + FEEDBACK
- At the top of the Add-ons step:
  Show a small status pill:
  “Mission Loadout: 3 Basic + 1 Premium required”
- As users select add-ons:
  - Update text dynamically:
    “2 Basic remaining”
    “Premium slot filled”
- When requirements are met:
  Show green confirmation:
  “Loadout Complete — Ready to Deploy”

3) ADD-ON SUMMARY (REINFORCE VALUE)
- At the bottom of the Add-ons step AND top of Contact step:
  Show a compact summary card:
  - Yard Size
  - Plan Tier
  - Selected Add-ons (pill-style tags)
  - Monthly Total
- Highlight included add-ons vs paid extras visually.
- This summary must auto-update if the user goes back and changes selections.

4) MICRO-ENGAGEMENT BANNERS (OPTIONAL, ROTATING)
- Insert a small banner between Add-ons → Contact:
  Examples:
  “Fun Fact: Most Huntsville lawns need aeration every 12–18 months.”
  “Pro Tip: Weekly mowing keeps Bermuda thicker and greener.”
- Rotate 3–5 messages randomly.
- Keep banners subtle and dismissible.

5) FINAL STEP COPY + CONFIDENCE
- Update Contact step headline to:
  “Mission Almost Complete”
- Subtext:
  “You’re requesting a FREE Dream Yard Recon. No payment required.”
- Make sure placeholder data (e.g., John Doe, fake addresses) are removed.

6) POST-SUBMIT “MISSION ACCOMPLISHED” CONFIRMATION
- After submission:
  Replace the default success message with a branded confirmation panel:
  Headline: “Mission Accomplished”
  Show:
    - Yard Size
    - Plan Tier
    - Selected Add-ons
    - Estimated Monthly Total
- Add CTA:
  “Join the Priority Waitlist for Lawn Trooper Elite (Launching Spring 2026)”
  → Email-only capture (optional)
- Add referral nudge:
  “Refer a neighbor — you both get 1 month free.”

7) PERFORMANCE & SAFETY CHECKS
- Ensure:
  - No horizontal scrolling introduced
  - No blocking animations
  - No impact to load time
- Add comments in code explaining how to disable gamification if needed.

DELIVERABLES
--------------------------------------------------
- List of files modified
- Short explanation of each feature added
- Manual test checklist (desktop + mobile)
- Confirmation that pricing and validation were untouched
