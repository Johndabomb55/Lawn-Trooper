You are a senior full-stack engineer and product strategist. You’re working on an existing Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind project for Lawn Trooper. The current site has a hero section with a quote wizard (“Dream Yard Recon”) and a minimal footer. Your task is to PLAN and then IMPLEMENT the following enhancements while preserving the quote wizard’s functionality:

1. **Add a “Why Lawn Trooper” section** below the hero. It should briefly list 3–4 bullet points highlighting: (a) electric equipment (low noise, zero emissions), (b) 25+ years of local experience and over 100 beautification awards, (c) AI‑powered efficiency and honest pricing, (d) fully licensed and insured.

2. **Add a plan overview section** above the “Why Lawn Trooper” section. This section displays three cards summarizing the “Basic Patrol”, “Premium Patrol”, and “Executive Command” plans. Each card should show:
   - Plan name and “from $X/mo” placeholder price.
   - Key inclusions (e.g. mowing frequency, weed control treatments).
   - A short “Perfect for…” blurb.
   - A button labeled “Build My Plan” that scrolls to the quote wizard.
   Use Tailwind’s grid utilities to make these cards responsive.

3. **Add a testimonials section** below the plan overview or at the bottom of the page (before the footer). Include 3–6 placeholder quotes (one sentence each) with star ratings and “Verified customer, [City]”. Use a simple card layout with Tailwind and add proper aria labels for accessibility.

4. **Refine copy and plan positioning**:
   - Update hero subheadline to: “North Alabama’s trusted lawn care service for 25+ years. Build your perfect plan in under 2 minutes.”
   - In the quote wizard, rename commitment options to “Flexible (Month‑to‑Month)”, “Popular (2‑Year Commitment)”, and “Best Value (3‑Year Commitment)”. Keep the existing pricing logic and free‑month incentives.
   - Tighten language throughout for clarity and brevity.

5. **Simplify add-ons** inside the quote wizard:
   - Group basic add-ons (e.g. extra bush trimming, shrub fertilization) and premium add-ons (e.g. irrigation check, aeration + overseeding, mulch delivery, pressure washing).
   - Clearly indicate how many add-ons are included with each plan and that additional add-ons cost $20–$40 per month.

6. **Ensure anchor links** from the new plan overview and bullet sections scroll smoothly to the quote wizard. Maintain responsiveness across devices and ensure accessibility (tab navigation, aria labels, contrast).

7. **Organize content and configuration**:
   - Move marketing copy (section headings, bullet text, plan summaries, testimonials) to a `content.ts` file.
   - Keep pricing and add-on values in `pricing.ts`.
   - Update the README to explain how to run and deploy the updated site on Replit.

8. **Testing and validation**:
   - After implementing the changes, run the app locally in Replit, ensuring the quote wizard still functions correctly and that the new sections appear where intended.
   - Confirm that the anchor links work, sections are responsive, and there are no console errors.
