ROLE:
You are a senior product engineer working on Lawn Trooper’s subscription quote system.
This is a RETROFIT, not a redesign. Keep layout, branding, and flow unless explicitly stated.
Your job is to fix pricing logic, simplify commitment options, and implement a premium, non-salesy savings system that is mathematically correct everywhere.

========================================
A) CORE SUBSCRIPTION MODEL (LOCKED)
========================================

1) Subscription structure:
- Lawn Trooper is a SUBSCRIPTION service.
- Customers choose commitment length, not “how they want to pay.”

2) Remove completely:
- “How do you want to pay?” buttons
- Monthly / Yearly / Pay-in-Full as separate payment methods
- Any legacy logic tied to those buttons

========================================
B) COMMITMENT OPTIONS (ONLY TWO)
========================================

3) Offer ONLY these commitment choices:

**Month-to-Month Subscription**
- +15% flexibility premium applied to entire subscription (plan + add-ons)
- No free months
- Cancel anytime

**2-Year Subscription (Price Lock)**
- Locks current pricing for 24 months
- Includes complimentary service months (defined below)

(1-Year may exist internally, but the primary promoted commitment is 2-Year.)

========================================
C) BASE FREE MONTHS (COMMITMENT BONUS)
========================================

4) Commitment free months:
- 1-Year → +1 free month
- 2-Year → +2 free months

Free months are SKIPPED BILLING MONTHS at the END of the agreement.

========================================
D) PAY-IN-FULL MULTIPLIER (VERY IMPORTANT)
========================================

5) Pay-in-Full behavior:
- Available ONLY on 2-Year subscriptions
- Implemented as a TOGGLE under the 2-Year option (not a payment selector)
- Label: “Pay in Full (Recommended)”

6) Rule:
- Pay in Full DOUBLES the COMMITMENT free months ONLY
- Promotional bonus months are NOT doubled

Therefore:
- 2-Year Monthly → 2 free months
- 2-Year Pay in Full → 4 free months

========================================
E) 25TH ANNIVERSARY ENROLLMENT BONUS
========================================

7) Implement a time-based enrollment bonus:
Name: **25th Anniversary Enrollment Bonus**

8) Bonus schedule:
- Enroll Dec 25 → Jan 25 → +2 bonus months
- Enroll Jan 25 → Feb 25 → +1 bonus month
- Enroll after Feb 25 → +0 bonus months (promotion concluded)

Rules:
- Bonus months apply once
- Bonus months are NOT doubled
- Bonus months stack with commitment + pay-in-full

========================================
F) FINAL FREE MONTH TOTALS (REFERENCE)
========================================

2-Year Monthly:
- Base: 2
- Bonus: 0–2
- Total: 2–4

2-Year Pay in Full:
- Commitment doubled: 4
- Bonus: 0–2
- Total possible: UP TO 6 free months

This is the MAX exposure. Do not exceed 6.

========================================
G) BILLING & MATH (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
========================================

9) Definitions:
- termMonths = 24
- freeMonths = commitment + (pay-in-full multiplier) + (bonus)
- billedMonths = termMonths − freeMonths

10) Pay-in-Full total:
totalDueNow = monthlySubscription × billedMonths

11) Effective monthly (displayed only, not billed):
effectiveMonthly = (monthlySubscription × billedMonths) ÷ 24

Rules:
- Effective monthly must ALWAYS be ≤ monthlySubscription
- No fractional free months
- Round dollars consistently

========================================
H) UI PRESENTATION (PREMIUM, NOT SALESY)
========================================

12) Language rules:
- Do NOT use: “stack and earn”, “huge discounts”, “half a year free”
- Use: “complimentary service months”, “price lock”, “early enrollment”

13) Commitment screen copy (example structure):
- “2-Year Subscription (Price Lock)”
  “Includes complimentary service months.”

- Pay in Full toggle:
  “Pay in full and double your complimentary months.”

14) Bonus disclosure (expandable / tooltip):
**25th Anniversary Enrollment Bonus**
- Enroll by Jan 25 → +2 months
- Enroll by Feb 25 → +1 month
- After Mar 25 → Enrollment concluded

After Mar 25, show crossed-out bonuses in muted text (do not remove).

========================================
I) SUMMARY SCREEN (THE ‘AHA’ MOMENT)
========================================

15) Final summary must show:
- Monthly subscription price
- Commitment length
- Free months earned (clearly itemized)
- Billed months vs total months
- Total due now (if pay in full)
- Effective monthly
- Savings vs Month-to-Month

Example:
“You’ll receive 24 months of service while paying for 18.”

========================================
J) CLEANUP & TESTING
========================================

16) Remove:
- Any legacy savings math
- Any comparison using non–15% month-to-month baseline
- Any duplicate plan explanation sections

17) Test ALL scenarios:
- Month-to-Month (price × 1.15)
- 2-Year Monthly (22 billed months)
- 2-Year Pay in Full (20 billed months)
- 2-Year Pay in Full + Feb bonus (19 billed months)
- 2-Year Pay in Full + Jan bonus (18 billed months)

Verify consistency across:
- Commitment screen
- Savings breakdown
- Summary page

Deliver a short report listing:
- Files changed
- Confirmation that math is correct everywhere
