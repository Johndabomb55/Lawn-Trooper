ROLE:
You are a senior product engineer improving Lawn Trooper’s live subscription website.
This is a RETROFIT. Do NOT redesign the site or change branding. Your job is to fix logic, restore missing options, correct copy, and ensure pricing math and wording are clear, correct, and consistent everywhere.

========================================
A) CORE PHILOSOPHY (MUST BE REFLECTED IN COPY)
========================================

Lawn Trooper values long-term relationships.
We reward commitment and loyalty.
We do NOT incentivize customers who come and go.

This philosophy must be clearly reflected in the wording:
- Month-to-Month = flexibility, no rewards
- 1-Year and 2-Year = rewarded with complimentary months

========================================
B) COMMITMENT OPTIONS (CRITICAL FIX)
========================================

Restore and clearly show THREE commitment options everywhere commitment is referenced:

1) Month-to-Month Subscription
   - Apply +15% flexibility premium to the entire subscription (plan + add-ons)
   - ZERO complimentary months
   - Cancel anytime
   - Copy must clearly state:
     “Month-to-month plans do not include complimentary months because we reward long-term commitment.”

2) 1-Year Subscription
   - Base commitment bonus: +1 complimentary month
   - Copy must clearly state:
     “Sign up for one year and receive one complimentary month as a thank-you for your commitment.”

3) 2-Year Subscription (Price Lock – Featured)
   - Base commitment bonus: +2 complimentary months
   - Pricing is locked for the full 2-year term
   - Visually feature this option as the best long-term value

The 1-Year option MUST be visible, selectable, and fully functional.
Do not hide it or treat it as internal-only.

========================================
C) PAY-IN-FULL LOGIC (TOGGLE, NOT PAYMENT METHOD)
========================================

Remove ALL “How do you want to pay?” buttons.
There must be NO Monthly / Yearly / Pay-in-Full payment selectors.

Implement Pay in Full as a TOGGLE under:
- 1-Year Subscription
- 2-Year Subscription

Pay-in-Full rule:
- Paying in full DOUBLES COMMITMENT FREE MONTHS ONLY
- Promotional or early enrollment bonus months are NOT doubled

Results:
- 1-Year Pay in Full → 2 complimentary months
- 2-Year Pay in Full → 4 complimentary months

========================================
D) 25TH ANNIVERSARY ENROLLMENT BONUS
========================================

Implement a time-based bonus named:
“25th Anniversary Enrollment Bonus”

Bonus schedule:
- Enroll Dec 25 → Jan 25 → +2 bonus complimentary months
- Enroll Jan 25 → Feb 25 → +1 bonus complimentary month
- Enroll after Feb 25 → +0 (promotion concluded)

Rules:
- Bonus months apply once
- Bonus months are NOT doubled
- Bonus months stack with commitment + pay-in-full

Maximum outcomes:
- 1-Year Pay in Full + Jan bonus → 3 complimentary months
- 2-Year Pay in Full + Jan bonus → 6 complimentary months

========================================
E) BILLING & SAVINGS MATH (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
========================================

Definitions:
- termMonths = 12 or 24
- freeMonths = commitment bonus + (pay-in-full multiplier) + (enrollment bonus)
- billedMonths = termMonths − freeMonths

Pay-in-Full total:
totalDueNow = monthlySubscription × billedMonths

Effective monthly (display only):
effectiveMonthly = (monthlySubscription × billedMonths) ÷ termMonths

Rules:
- Effective monthly must ALWAYS be less than or equal to the base monthly price
- No fractional months
- Savings comparisons MUST use the Month-to-Month price (15% premium baseline)

========================================
