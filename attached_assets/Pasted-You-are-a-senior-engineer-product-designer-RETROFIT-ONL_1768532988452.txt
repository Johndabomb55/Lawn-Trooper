You are a senior engineer + product designer. RETROFIT ONLY. Do not redesign or rebuild.
Your goal is to fix pricing math, add-on logic, and terminology so the Lawn Trooper site behaves like a clean subscription configurator.

====================================
A) TERMINOLOGY
====================================
1) Update wording across the site to reflect “subscription lawn service” where appropriate:
- “Subscription Plan”
- “Build My Subscription”
- “Subscription add-ons”
Do not overdo it. Keep tone friendly and residential.

====================================
B) PLAN PRICING LOGIC
====================================
2) Preserve marketing anchors:
- Basic from $169
- Premium from $299
- Executive from $399
These remain visible until yard size is selected.

3) Internally, plan value increases ~20% per tier.
If this conflicts with displayed anchors, apply the 20% logic to the service/labor component only.
Do NOT override the visible “from $” prices.

4) Yard size modifies base plan pricing as currently implemented.

====================================
C) ADD-ONS SOURCE OF TRUTH
====================================
5) Use one canonical add-on catalog everywhere.
Remove any stub or duplicate lists.

6) Add-on pairing rule:
- Basic add-on = smaller / limited version
- Premium add-on = larger / bundled version
Judge by wording, not by plan.

Add these premium add-ons:
- “Soft Wash Premium Package (Annual): driveway, sidewalk, front porch, steps, mailbox”
- “House Soft Wash”

Trash can:
- Quarterly = Basic
- Monthly = Premium

Do not label add-ons as monthly/seasonal in UI.

====================================
D) EXECUTIVE ADD-ON LOGIC
====================================
7) Executive included add-ons:
- 3 Basic + 2 Premium

8) Executive swap buttons (always visible, Executive only):
- No Swap → 3B + 2P
- Swap 1 Premium → +2 Basic → 5B + 1P
- Swap 2 Premium → +4 Basic → 7B + 0P

Swap affects INCLUDED LIMITS only.

====================================
E) ADD-ON COUNTERS & REMAPPING
====================================
9) Show counters everywhere:
- Selected: X Basic, Y Premium
- Included: A Basic + B Premium
- Overages: +$20 per Basic, +$40 per Premium

10) Never hide add-ons.
Overages update price live.

11) When switching plans, intelligently remap selections.
If something becomes ineligible, auto-remove with a clear notice.

====================================
F) COMMITMENT, FREE MONTHS & PAYMENT
====================================
12) Free months:
- 1-year = +1
- 2-year = +3
No cap. All stackable.

13) Month-to-month:
- Apply +15% to plan + add-ons.

14) Pay in full:
- Apply all free months immediately.
- billedMonths = termMonths - freeMonths
- totalPayNow = monthlySubscription * billedMonths
Show:
- “Pay in full — unlock maximum savings”
- Total savings vs month-to-month.

15) Effective monthly formula (must be correct everywhere):
effectiveMonthly = (monthlySubscription * billedMonths) / termMonths
Guard against inverted math.

====================================
G) REQUIRED FIXES
====================================
16) Fix Basic plan incorrectly showing Premium selection.
17) Ensure every selection updates price immediately at:
- Step 3
- Step 4
- Step 5
- Step 6 summary

====================================
H) DELIVERABLES
====================================
18) Provide:
- Files changed
- Source-of-truth files
- Confirmation all test cases pass
