You are a senior product engineer working in the Lawn Trooper Replit codebase.

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT refactor the entire wizard architecture.
- Keep the same wizard steps and routing.
- Only redesign Step 2 UI (Plan selection) and its selection state so Step 3 still works.
- Do NOT change pricing or plan names.
- Preserve current styling/brand (colors, typography, spacing).
- Make changes surgically. If something already matches the requirement, leave it unchanged.

ASSUMPTION:
Stage 1 has already centralized plan config and fixed slot counts/logic.
Use that shared plan config as the source of truth.

GOAL:
Redesign Step 2 (Plan Selection) so customers instantly understand:
1) What’s included (locked)
2) What’s included but swappable (upgrade slots)
3) How swapping works (basic vs premium slots, conversion button)
Without making the wizard longer or more complex.

---------------------------------------
STEP 2 NEW UX (MUST IMPLEMENT)
---------------------------------------

A) Top row: 3 plan cards only
- Basic Patrol ($169/mo)
- Premium Patrol ($299/mo)
- Executive Command ($399/mo)

Each card shows:
- Plan name
- Price
- One-liner summary (short)
- Included slot counts (Basic slots / Premium slots)
Selecting a card highlights it.

B) When a plan is selected, render a DETAILS PANEL directly BELOW the cards (same page)
The panel has three sections:

1) INCLUDED (LOCKED) ✅
- List non-negotiable features from plan config (mowing schedule, off-season cadence, account manager access if included, turf defense if included, bed weed control cadence).
- These cannot be swapped.

2) INCLUDED UPGRADES (SWAPPABLE) 🔁✅
- Show slots as “Basic Upgrade Slots” and “Premium Upgrade Slots”
- Show default selections pre-selected IF the code already has defaults.
  - If no defaults exist, show “Pick your included upgrades” with empty slot placeholders.
- These are swappable within their category.

3) SWAP OPTIONS
- Two tabs or two columns:
  - “Basic Upgrades”
  - “Premium Upgrades”
- Clicking an option swaps it into an available slot of that type.
- Show live slot counters and remaining slots.

C) Conversion (Premium + Executive only)
- Add a clear button:
  “Convert 2 Basic → +1 Premium”
- If feasible, allow reverse:
  “Convert 1 Premium → +2 Basic”
- Conversion must update counters and enforce slot limits.
- Basic plan must NOT show conversion controls.

D) Icon language (keep dead simple)
- ✅ Included (locked)
- 🔁✅ Included upgrade (swappable)
- ➕ Optional paid add-on (ONLY if already supported; do not invent new paid logic)

---------------------------------------
EXECUTIVE+ TOGGLE (ONLY ON EXECUTIVE)
---------------------------------------
When Executive Command is selected:
- Show a toggle within Step 2 (either on the card or in the details panel):
  “Executive+ Upgrade (+$99/mo)”
- When enabled:
  - Add +1 Basic slot and +1 Premium slot
  - Add locked perks: Quarterly Strategy Session + Rapid Response Priority
  - Upgrade the allowance label to “Expanded Landscape Allowance™”
- Ensure the total monthly price updates and Step 3 receives updated slot counts.

---------------------------------------
LANDSCAPE ALLOWANCE LANGUAGE (NO DOLLARS / NO YARDS)
---------------------------------------
Use only tier labels:
- Premium: Seasonal Landscape Refresh Allowance™
- Executive: Premier Landscape Allowance™
- Executive+ : Expanded Landscape Allowance™
In the details panel, show a short helper line:
“An included allowance you can apply toward mulch/pine straw refreshes, bed enhancements, pruning upgrades, and cleanups. Resets annually. Specialty materials may require additional upgrade.”

---------------------------------------
STEP 3 COMPATIBILITY (MUST NOT BREAK)
---------------------------------------
- Step 3 must start with the selected included upgrades from Step 2.
- Slot enforcement must still work exactly as Stage 1 defined.
- If Step 3 has its own UI, keep it, but it must reflect choices made in Step 2.

---------------------------------------
YARD SIZE LABEL CLEANUP (IF NOT ALREADY DONE)
---------------------------------------
Ensure Step 1 yard cards show ONLY:
Small: Up to 1/3 acre
Medium: 1/3 – 2/3 acre
Large: 2/3 – 1 acre

---------------------------------------
ACCEPTANCE TESTS
---------------------------------------
After implementing:
1) Small yard → Basic Patrol
   - Details panel renders correctly
   - Shows 2 Basic slots
   - No conversion button
   - Step 3 requires exactly 2 Basic selections

2) Small yard → Premium Patrol
   - Shows 3 Basic + 1 Premium slots
   - Conversion button works (2 Basic → +1 Premium)
   - Step 3 reflects the same

3) Small yard → Executive Command
   - Shows 3 Basic + 3 Premium slots
   - Conversion works
   - Executive+ toggle appears
   - Toggle adds +1 Basic +1 Premium and increases price +$99/mo
   - Step 3 reflects updated slots and price

OUTPUT:
- List all files changed
- Briefly explain the Step 2 state shape and how it passes to Step 3
- Confirm no console errors
- Provide a quick click-through test guide
