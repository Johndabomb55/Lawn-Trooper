You are a senior product engineer and conversion-focused UX strategist.

Context:
lawn-trooper.com already has a working multi-step quote wizard.
Recent work has introduced some inconsistencies and unfinished logic.
This task is to CLEAN, UNIFY, and FINALIZE the system into a single,
cohesive marketing and sales experience.

You must be careful, deliberate, and incremental.
Do NOT break existing functionality.

GOAL:
Turn the plan picker (multi-step quote wizard) into a clear, premium,
commitment-driven sales system that:
- Rewards early commitment with free months
- Rewards long-term loyalty with price reduction over time
- Keeps monthly prices anchored and premium
- Hides internal pricing logic
- Protects intellectual property
- Feels trustworthy, calm, and confident

------------------------------------------------
GLOBAL RULES
------------------------------------------------
- Do NOT change base monthly prices
- Do NOT introduce payment collection
- Do NOT expose internal formulas or cost math
- Do NOT mention “neighborhood marketing” publicly
- Customers may quit anytime; free months are forfeited if they do
- All free months are applied at the END of the contract
- Use simple language; avoid hype

------------------------------------------------
STEP 0 — AUDIT FIRST (NO CHANGES)
------------------------------------------------
Before changing anything:
- List all files involved in:
  - The plan picker / wizard
  - Promotions logic
  - Plan definitions
  - CTAs
- Identify:
  - Duplicate CTAs
  - Obsolete promotions
  - Any exposed pricing math
STOP and confirm understanding before proceeding.

------------------------------------------------
STEP 1 — CLEANUP & CONSISTENCY
------------------------------------------------
- Remove the extra “Get Instant Quote” buttons that do not add value.
  Keep only:
  - The primary navigation CTA
  - The inline plan picker
- Remove any overlapping or partially hidden hero text.
- Ensure only ONE plan picker exists.
- Remove obsolete promotions (e.g. “pay in full extra 2 months free”).

------------------------------------------------
STEP 2 — ADD A SMALL “ABOUT US” INTRO
------------------------------------------------
Add a short paragraph near the top of the homepage:

“Lawn Trooper is built on commitment, efficiency, and loyalty.
We’ve spent decades putting relationships before scale.
As we adopt new automation, technology, and processes,
we’re now passing those savings back to our customers.
Commit to us, and we commit to you.”

Keep it short. No wall of text.

------------------------------------------------
STEP 3 — PLAN TIERS (DO NOT CHANGE STRUCTURE)
------------------------------------------------
- Keep existing plan tiers and services.
- Add a compact comparison view that shows:
  - Mowing frequency
  - Weed treatment frequency
  - Bush trimming frequency
  - Included add-ons count
- Do NOT list every add-on.
- Make Basic feel solid, Premium smart, Executive elite.

------------------------------------------------
STEP 4 — COMMITMENT & PROMOTIONS (CORE LOGIC)
------------------------------------------------
Implement the following commitment model:

EARLY BIRD PROMOTION (LIMITED TIME)
- Promotion runs Jan 25 → Apr 25
- Each month that passes removes 1 free month
- Display urgency visually (timeline or countdown)
- After promotion ends, no early bird free months remain

COMMITMENT REWARDS
- 1-Year commitment → 1 free month
- 2-Year commitment → 2 free months
- 3-Year commitment → 3 free months

PAY IN FULL BONUS
- Paying in full adds +1 additional free month
- Applies to all terms

MAX FREE MONTHS CAP
- Maximum total free months: 6

------------------------------------------------
STEP 5 — OPERATION PRICE DROP (LOYALTY)
------------------------------------------------
Implement “Operation Price Drop”:

- After Year 1: 5% price reduction on renewal
- After Year 2: 10% price reduction on renewal
- After Year 3: 15% price reduction on renewal

Rules:
- This applies ONLY on renewal
- This is not a discount today
- Show as a future benefit, not current savings
- Display visually as a timeline, not math

------------------------------------------------
STEP 6 — PROMOTION CODE (HIDDEN POWER)
------------------------------------------------
- Add a generic field:
  “Have a promotion code?”
- No explanation of how codes are distributed
- Codes may unlock:
  - HOA partnership discount (10%)
- Copy should say:
  “If your HOA is partnered with Lawn Trooper,
   you may qualify for additional savings.”

------------------------------------------------
STEP 7 — HOA PARTNERSHIP FORM
------------------------------------------------
Add a separate HOA inquiry section:
- HOA name
- Contact name
- Phone number
- Email
- Notes / directions
Text:
“If your HOA partners with Lawn Trooper,
residents receive additional benefits.”

------------------------------------------------
STEP 8 — FINAL SUMMARY & CONFIRMATION
------------------------------------------------
Before submission, show:
- Selected plan
- Commitment length
- Free months earned
- Future loyalty benefits (Operation Price Drop)
- Clear message:
  “No payment required.
   No obligation.
   Free Dream Yard Recon.”

------------------------------------------------
DELIVERABLES
------------------------------------------------
- Step-by-step implementation plan
- File list with changes
- Confirmation nothing breaks
- Confirmation pricing remains anchored
