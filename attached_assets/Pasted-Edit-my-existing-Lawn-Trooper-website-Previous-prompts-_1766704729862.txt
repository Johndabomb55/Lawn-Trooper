Edit my existing Lawn Trooper website. Previous prompts are already applied.
DO NOT redesign or repeat prior work. Apply ONLY the updates below.

1) AUTOMATIC PRICING (INTERNAL ONLY)
- Pricing must auto-calculate from customer-entered lot size.
- Internal rule (never shown): +25% per additional 1/3 acre.
- Applies to ALL plans.
- Customer sees final price only (no math, no acreage logic).

2) LOT SIZE INPUT (REQUIRED)
- Add required field: “Approximate Lot Size (acres)”
- Allow decimals (ex: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75).
- Price must update when this value changes.
- Final pricing cannot be confirmed without this input.

3) CUSTOMER PRICING DISCLOSURE
- Near pricing or lot size input:
  “Pricing adjusts based on lot size and is verified during the consultation and walkthrough.”
- Add once more elsewhere (pricing/FAQ/footer):
  “Anniversary Sale pricing applies to typical neighborhood yards. Larger or more complex lots may require price adjustment.”
- Do NOT mention percentages, acreage fractions, or formulas anywhere.

4) ANNIVERSARY SALE + LIVE COUNTDOWN
- Show “Anniversary Sale Price” everywhere pricing appears.
- Starting price must always read: “$129/month”.
- Remove ALL “up to 1 acre” language.
- Add a LIVE countdown timer at the top of the page (updates in real time).
- Countdown label:
  “Anniversary Sale Ends January 1st”
- Countdown must reflect a sale end time of:
  January 1st at 11:59 PM (end of day), local time.
- Use one configurable end-date variable.
- When the countdown reaches zero:
  - Stop the timer
  - Replace sale messaging with “Anniversary Sale Ended”
  - Hide or disable sale-specific pricing callouts
- Must work on mobile and desktop without page refresh.
- Ensure ALL sale messaging references January 1st (no Dec 31 language anywhere).

5) PLANS & COPY CLEANUP
- Plans must be named ONLY:
  Basic Patrol
  Premium Patrol
  Executive Patrol
- Remove “weekly mowing and edging” from Basic Patrol.
- Remove any incorrect text such as “two basic add-ons”.
- Under each plan name show:
  “Includes: X Basic Add-ons • Y Premium Add-ons”
- Use existing plan data if dynamic (do not hardcode unless required).

6) MAINTENANCE FREQUENCY LOGIC (IF PRESENT)
- Bi-weekly → ONLY Basic Patrol selectable.
- Weekly → Basic Patrol disabled, auto-select Premium Patrol (Executive still allowed).

7) ADD-ONS (LABELS ONLY)
Basic Add-ons:
- Extra Bush Trimming

8) EXECUTIVE BONUS RULE
- If Executive Patrol + pay full term upfront → allow ONE additional Premium add-on.

9) CONTACT INFO PRIVACY
- Remove any business street address from the site (footer, contact section, metadata, schema).
- Display ONLY this contact email:
  lawntrooperllc@gmail.com
- Do not show a physical address anywhere.

10) FINAL CHECK
