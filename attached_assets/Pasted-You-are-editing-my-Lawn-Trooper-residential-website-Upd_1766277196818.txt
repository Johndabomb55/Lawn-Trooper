You are editing my Lawn Trooper residential website. Update the “Plans & Pricing” and “Add-Ons” sections to match the exact plan structure below. Do NOT invent extra inclusions. Do NOT include any add-on inside a plan unless it is explicitly listed as “Included.”

GOALS:
- Make the plans easy to understand and premium.
- Prevent scope creep with clear “Included vs Add-Ons vs Not Included” language.
- Pricing is for up to 1/3 acre.
- Yard size increases are in 1/3 acre steps (not 1/4).
- Mention robotics/technology selection is decided by Lawn Trooper.

Add a short “Premium promise” line:

YARD SIZE PRICING SECTION (applies to all plans)
Add a small block titled “Yard Size Pricing”
- “Prices above apply to yards up to 1/3 acre.”
- “For larger yards, pricing increases in 1/3 acre steps.”
Provide example tiers (no exact dollar amounts required if you prefer):
- Up to 1/3 acre: base plan price
- 1/3–2/3 acre: increased
- 2/3–1 acre: increased
- 1–1 1/3 acre: increased
- Over 1 1/3 acre: custom quote

ADD/UPDATE PAGE SECTION: “Service Limits / Exclusions”
Add a clear disclaimer:
- “Tree removals, stump grinding, heavy storm damage, and construction landscaping are not included and require a separate quote.”
- “Only services listed as Included are included.”

STYLE REQUIREMENTS
- Use short headings, clean bullet lists, no giant paragraphs.
- Make the plan comparison easy to scan.
- Add a prominent CTA button under each plan: “Get My Quote” linking to the quote/contact form.
