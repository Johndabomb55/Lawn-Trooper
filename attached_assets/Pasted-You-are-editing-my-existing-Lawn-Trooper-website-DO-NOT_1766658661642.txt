You are editing my existing Lawn Trooper website. DO NOT redesign from scratch. Keep the current theme, colors, layout style, and sections unless explicitly instructed. Goal: improve conversion by leading with a simple “Instant Quote” hook, reduce confusion, and remove all acreage math language.

HIGH PRIORITY CHANGES (Conversion + Clarity)

1) HERO / TOP SECTION (above the fold)
- Make the primary headline focused on instant pricing:
  Headline: “Instant Pricing in 30 Seconds”
  Subheadline: “Total landscape maintenance plans for under-1-acre neighborhood yards starting at $129/month”
- Add a limited-time promo badge/callout near the CTA:
  “Next 5 days only: get up to 3 months FREE”
- Primary CTA button text should be:
  “Get My Instant Quote”
- Secondary CTA (smaller) can be:
  “See What’s Included”

2) REMOVE ALL ACREAGE MATH / INTERNAL PRICING LANGUAGE
- Remove ANY mention of:
  - “1/3 acre”
  - “1/4 acre”
  - “25% increase”
  - “per additional third”
  - any “25%” pricing rule language anywhere on the site
This is private internal logic and should not appear on the website.

3) INSTANT QUOTE FLOW (Lightweight, not a new page unless needed)
- Keep the existing quote/pricing area, but improve the first-step questions so it feels fast and impressive.
- Present the quote as “instant” with just a few simple questions before showing price.
- The very first and most important question should be:
  “Is your property under 1 acre?”
  Options: “Yes” and “Not sure (we can help)”
- Next question:
  “Maintenance frequency”
  Options: “Weekly” and “Bi-weekly”
- Optional third question (if you already have plan tiers):
  “Pick your style”
  Options: “Basic” “Best Value” “Premium”
- After these, show the pricing/result area immediately.

4) PRICING COPY (Simple, clean, non-technical)
- Everywhere pricing is discussed, keep it simple:
  “Plans start at $129/month for under-1-acre neighborhood yards.”
- If there is a “starting at” label, make it prominent near the instant quote result.

5) “WHY ARE YOU LOWERING PRICES?” TRUST SECTION
- Add a short FAQ or section (where FAQs/testimonials fit best) with this question:
  Q: “Why are you lowering prices after 25+ years?”
  A: “Short answer: AI. We use AI to cut wasted time, improve routing and scheduling, and reduce overhead. Most companies keep the savings — we pass them to you. Same quality. Smarter systems. Better prices.”
- Keep it friendly, confident, and not overly technical.

6) REFERRAL PROGRAM HIGHLIGHT
- Add a small but noticeable section or callout near pricing or near the footer:
  Headline: “Excellent Referral Program”
  Text: “Refer a neighbor and get rewarded.”
  Button: “See Referral Rewards” (link to existing referral details section/page if it exists; if not, create a simple modal/section with placeholder text that I can fill in later.)

7) KEEP CURRENT DESIGN + CLEAN UP
- Keep the site’s current design and structure overall.
- Do not add clutter.
- Ensure mobile looks clean: hero headline, promo badge, and “Get My Instant Quote” button should be visible without excessive scrolling.

DELIVERABLE
- Implement these changes in the existing codebase.
- Confirm there are ZERO occurrences of “25%”, “1/3”, “1/4”, or “additional third” anywhere in the site content after edits.
