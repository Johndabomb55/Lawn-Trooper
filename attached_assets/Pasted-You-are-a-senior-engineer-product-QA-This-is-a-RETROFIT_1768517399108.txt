You are a senior engineer + product QA. This is a RETROFIT job (do not rewrite). Your job is to (1) run a Source-of-Truth audit, (2) propose a minimal-change plan, (3) implement the approved changes, and (4) re-test end-to-end so we do not break anything.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Do NOT rebuild from scratch. Do incremental refactors only.
- Preserve the current UI look and overall flow unless explicitly requested.
- The site must match the Source of Truth config after this work.
- Remove the word "commercial" everywhere. Use "Multi-Home Community / Over 1 Acre" only.
- The online tool is NOT called "Dream Yard Recon" (that is in-person). Public CTAs remain: "Start My Free Quote" and "Build My Plan".
- Add-ons must update price live with every selection.
- Free months are skipped billing months at the END (not credits/discounts).

PHASE 1 — AUDIT (do this first, before code changes):
1) Locate where plan definitions, add-ons, free months, and payment options are currently stored.
2) Identify any hardcoded numbers/text in components that should be config-driven.
3) Search for drift (e.g., Premium shows 4 weed treatments in one place and 2 somewhere else; Executive missing storm/winter perks in some spots).
4) Output a short "Audit Findings" list:
   - Which values are hardcoded
   - Which config files exist / missing
   - Which screens are out of sync
   - Which changes are low-risk vs high-risk

PHASE 2 — SOURCE OF TRUTH CONFIG (create/normalize):
Create or update these files and move values into them:
- src/config/plans.ts
- src/config/addons.ts
- src/config/promotions.ts
- src/config/content.ts

These configs must drive:
- Plan cards (Basic/Premium/Executive)
- Plan detail modals
- Wizard step labels and inclusions
- Price calculations and summary
- Promotions page

SOURCE OF TRUTH (IMPLEMENT EXACTLY):

PROPERTY TYPES:
- Residential Home
- Multi-Home Community / Over 1 Acre
Trigger custom quote if:
  a) Multi-Home Community selected, OR
  b) Residential property > 1 acre
This is not a rejection. Copy: "We can service any residential property. Larger properties and communities receive a custom quote within 1 business day."

PLANS:
Basic Patrol:
- Keep existing baseline mowing and current included items unless changed below.

Premium Patrol:
- Weed control: 4 treatments/year (everywhere).
- Allowance: 2 Basic add-ons included + 1 Premium add-on included.
- Premium plan cannot swap premium slot for basics.

Executive Command:
- Includes by default:
  - Priority mowing
  - After-storm visits included (small limbs/debris)
  - Bi-weekly winter visits & yard checks
  - Commander’s Club access (1 premium add-on free on anniversary)
- Allowance options:
  - Default: 2 Basic + 1 Premium
  - Executive-only swap toggle: user may choose "No Premium Add-On" and instead get +2 Basic slots (total 4 Basic).
  (Premium plan does NOT get this option.)

ADD-ONS:
Only two tiers exist: Basic Add-Ons and Premium Add-Ons.
Add-ons must impact price live.
Christmas lights shown year-round in BOTH tiers:
- Christmas Lights (Basic): simple install (no roofline, no yard pop-ups)
- Christmas Lights (Premium): roofline + flower bed + yard pop-ups

FREE MONTHS + PAY:
Free months are skipped billing months at END.
Example copy: "If you earn 2 free months on a 12-month plan, you pay for the first 10 months. Your final 2 months are not billed."
Options:
- Month-to-month (higher price / flexibility premium)
- 1-year (+1 free month)
- 2-year (+2 free months)
- Pay in full (+1 additional free month OR additional savings — keep consistent with existing implementation, but explain clearly)

PROMOTIONS PAGE:
Create /promotions (or /savings) page that is separate from the main flow:
- It shows all ways to save (term, pay method, free months)
- Shows: monthly payment (actual), months billed vs free, effective monthly, total savings
- Copy includes: "Commit to us, and we commit to you."
- Promotions page must not clutter the plan selection steps.

COPY / BRAND VOICE:
- Military style, friendly, residential Alabama vibe.
- More business info (25 years, awards, electric, honest pricing) but concise.
- No “commercial” vibe.

PHASE 3 — IMPLEMENTATION (minimal-change):
- Update the wizard so free-month badge does NOT appear before commitment step (or change it to "Free months available with annual plans" before that step).
- Ensure all plan cards and modals match the plan config (Premium 4 treatments; Executive storm + winter perks + commander’s club).
- Restore full add-on catalog and enforce included counts per plan + exec swap toggle.
- Ensure HOA/large property goes to custom quote form with correct CTA text ("Request Custom Quote") not "Start My Free Quote".

PHASE 4 — TEST + CONFIRM:
Run locally and confirm:
- Residential flow works end-to-end (Step 1 → submit) with live pricing changes.
- Multi-home / over-1-acre routes to custom quote and does not show instant pricing.
- Promotions page loads and calculations match commitment step.
- No mismatched numbers across cards, modals, wizard, and summary.
- No console errors.

DELIVERABLE:
- Short final report listing:
  a) Files changed
  b) What moved into config
  c) Confirmed tests passed
  d) Any remaining TODOs
Then commit/publish.
