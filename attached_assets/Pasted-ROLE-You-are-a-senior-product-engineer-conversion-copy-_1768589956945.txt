ROLE:
You are a senior product engineer + conversion copy editor improving lawn-trooper.com.
RETROFIT ONLY. Do not redesign the site. Keep layout and styling. Update copy and logic to match the source-of-truth rules below and ensure clarity + premium tone.

PRIMARY GOAL:
Market the 25th Anniversary offer in a premium “two-layer reveal” way (hint → explain → show), and make it crystal clear that “free months” are SKIPPED BILLING MONTHS AT THE END OF THE TERM (the agreement still ends on its normal anniversary date).

========================================
A) DEFINITIONS (NON-NEGOTIABLE COPY RULE)
========================================

1) Replace any wording that implies customers receive “extra months of service” beyond the contract end date.
2) Use ONLY this concept:
- “Complimentary months” = months NOT BILLED at the end of the term
- Term still ends exactly 12 or 24 months from signup

Approved phrasing to use in the builder and summary:
- “Complimentary months are skipped billing months at the end of your term.”
- “Your agreement still ends on your 12-month or 24-month anniversary date.”
- “You pay for fewer months, but your subscription term remains the same length.”

========================================
B) PREMIUM MARKETING STRUCTURE (TWO-LAYER REVEAL)
========================================

3) Homepage / hero area:
- Do NOT shout numbers.
- Add a calm line:
  “Celebrating 25 years—long-term subscribers can earn complimentary billing months.”

4) Plan cards / plan picker (pre-builder):
- Do NOT show “up to 6” here.
- Add a subtle line or tooltip:
  “Complimentary billing months may apply based on commitment and enrollment timing.”

5) Inside the plan builder:
- Add a “Savings Breakdown” panel or expandable area titled:
  “Earn Complimentary Billing Months”
- This is where you may reveal “up to 6 months” with calm language:
  “During our 25th Anniversary enrollment period, you may earn up to 6 skipped billing months.”

6) Final summary screen:
- Show the earned months and the breakdown.
- Include the “skipped billing months at the end” disclaimer prominently (see section F).

========================================
C) COMMITMENT OPTIONS (LOCKED)
========================================

7) Show THREE commitment options:
- Month-to-Month (15% flexibility premium, 0 complimentary months)
- 1-Year Subscription
- 2-Year Subscription (Price Lock – featured)

8) Month-to-Month must clearly say:
“Month-to-month subscriptions do not include complimentary billing months because we reward commitment and long-term relationships.”

========================================
D) FREE MONTH RULES (LOCKED)
========================================

9) Commitment bonus:
- 1-Year = +1 complimentary billing month
- 2-Year = +2 complimentary billing months

10) Pay-in-full toggle:
- Doubles commitment months ONLY (promo bonus months not doubled)
- 1-Year Pay in Full => 2 commitment months (before bonus)
- 2-Year Pay in Full => 4 commitment months (before bonus)

11) 25th Anniversary Enrollment Bonus:
- Dec 25 → Jan 25 = +2 bonus months
- Jan 25 → Feb 25 = +1 bonus month
- After Feb 25 = +0
- Bonus months are NOT doubled

12) Max outcomes:
- 1-Year Pay in Full + Jan bonus => 3 total months
- 2-Year Pay in Full + Jan bonus => 6 total months

========================================
E) MATH (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
========================================

13) Use these definitions:
- termMonths = 12 or 24
- freeMonths = commitment + (pay-in-full multiplier) + enrollment bonus
- billedMonths = termMonths − freeMonths

14) Effective monthly display:
effectiveMonthly = (monthlySubscription × billedMonths) ÷ termMonths

Rules:
- effectiveMonthly must always be <= monthlySubscription
- no fractional months
- use Month-to-Month (15% premium baseline) for “savings vs month-to-month” comparisons

========================================
F) REQUIRED DISCLAIMER (PROMINENT)
========================================

15) Add this disclaimer at the end of the plan builder (Step 5 or Step 6) and again on final summary:

“Complimentary months are skipped billing months applied at the end of your term. Your subscription still ends on your 12-month or 24-month anniversary date.”

Optional second line:
“You receive the same term length—you simply pay for fewer months.”

========================================
G) QA / TESTING (REQUIRED)
========================================

16) Test every button and reaction:
- switching plans changes totals correctly
- toggling pay-in-full updates free months + totals
- changing enrollment window updates bonus months correctly
- month-to-month always shows 0 free months and 15% premium applied
- 1-year and 2-year show correct max totals (3 and 6)
- effective monthly never exceeds monthly payment
- summary matches what was selected

17) Output a short report:
- files changed
- which screens got copy changes
- confirmation that “skipped billing months” is clearly stated and consistent
- confirmation math is correct everywhere
